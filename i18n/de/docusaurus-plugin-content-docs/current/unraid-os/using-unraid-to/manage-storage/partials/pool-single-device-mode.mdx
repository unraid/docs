In **single device mode**, your %%cache pool|cache-pool%% consists of only one device. This means:

- **No redundancy:** If the device fails, any data stored on it that hasn't been transferred to your %%array|array%% will be lost.
- **Dateisystemoptionen:** Sie k√∂nnen andere Dateisysteme als %%BTRFS|btrfs%% verwenden, wie %%XFS|xfs%% oder %%ZFS|zfs%%.

If you choose a non-%%BTRFS|btrfs%% or non-%%ZFS|zfs%% file system in single device mode and later decide to add more devices to the pool, you will need to reformat the device as %%BTRFS|btrfs%% or %%ZFS|zfs%% first. That's why %%BTRFS|btrfs%% is the default file system for %%cache pools|cache-pool%%, even when using just one device. Both %%BTRFS|btrfs%% and %%ZFS|zfs%% support adding devices later to create mirrored pools. For more information on file system selection and compatibility, see [File systems](../file-systems.mdx).

Single device mode is straightforward. You can easily add or remove the device, but you won't have options for advanced features like redundancy or expansion.
