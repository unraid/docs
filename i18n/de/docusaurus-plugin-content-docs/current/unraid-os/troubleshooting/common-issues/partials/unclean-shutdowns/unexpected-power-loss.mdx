Power interruptions are one of the main reasons for unclean shutdowns. Protect your system with a properly configured UPS that can automatically shut down Unraid before the battery runs out.

:::note
Unraid supports most UPS units using the %%apcupsd Protocol|apcupsd%% protocol (APC and CyberPower are usually compatible). If your UPS isn't supported, consider using the Network UPS Tools (NUT) plugin from Community Applications.
