Starting with Unraid 7.0, XFS file system repair is now fully automated through the WebGUI:

1. **Initial Check**: Click the **CHECK** button (no options to enter)
2. **Check Results**:
   - **No corruption detected**: Shows "no filesystem corruption detected" and the **CHECK** button remains
   - **Corruption detected**: Shows "filesystem corruption detected" and a **FIX** button appears
3. **Repair Process**: Click **FIX** to automatically repair the file system
4. **Additional Actions**: If needed, a **ZERO LOG** button may appear
5. **Completion**: Shows "filesystem repaired" when the process is complete

This automated system eliminates the need for users to manually enter repair options and ensures the correct repair sequence is followed.

:::note

- Repairs maintain %%parity|parity%% protection and can take significant time.
- Both %%WebGUI|web-gui%% and command-line options are supported for %%XFS|xfs%% repair (commands shown below).
