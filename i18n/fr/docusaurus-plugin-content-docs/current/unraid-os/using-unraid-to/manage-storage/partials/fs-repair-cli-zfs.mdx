%%ZFS|zfs%% pools offer built-in integrity checking and self-healing capabilities, which often eliminate the need for traditional file system repairs.

<h4>For %%ZFS|zfs%% pools</h4>

- **Check pool health:** Use the command `zpool status poolname` to see the status of your pool.
- **Run a scrub:** Execute `zpool scrub poolname`. This command detects and repairs any corruption automatically.
- **Clear errors:** After addressing any underlying issues, run `zpool clear poolname` to clear the error state.

<h4>For %%ZFS|zfs%% disks in the array</h4>

- **Check dataset health:** Use `zfs list -o name,health` to check the health of your datasets.
- **Run a scrub:** You can also run `zpool scrub poolname` for any disks belonging to a specific pool.

%%ZFS|zfs%% automatically identifies and fixes data corruption when redundancy is available, such as in mirrors or %%RAIDZ1|raidz1%%/%%RAIDZ2|raidz2%%/%%RAIDZ3|raidz3%% configurations. Unlike traditional file systems, %%ZFS|zfs%% typically does not require manual repair commands because it continuously monitors data integrity with checksums.
