1. **Disable Docker and %%VM|vm%% services** as described above.
2. Use `rsync` or `mv` commands to transfer files between mount points (e.g., `/mnt/pool1/share` to `/mnt/pool2/share`).
3. Verify the files before deleting them from the original pool.
4. Re-enable Docker and %%VM|vm%% services.

:::caution
Always check your file paths and use the correct share names to prevent data loss.
