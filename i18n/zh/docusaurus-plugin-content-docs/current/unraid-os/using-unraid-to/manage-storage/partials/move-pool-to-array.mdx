Moving files off the %%cache pool|cache-pool%% to the %%array|array%% before performing maintenance or upgrades to ensure your data is safe.

:::

To move files from your pool to the %%array|array%%:

1. **Disable Docker and %%VM|vm%% services**: Go to **Settings** and turn off Docker and %%VM|vm%% Manager. This prevents any files from being held open, allowing the %%Mover|mover%% to transfer everything smoothly.
2. **Set share storage and Mover action (cache → array)**: In the **Shares** tab, for each share you want to move (like `appdata` or `system`), set **Primary storage** to the source %%cache pool|cache-pool%% and **Secondary storage** to the %%array|array%%. Set **Mover action** to **cache → array**.
3. **Run %%Mover|mover%%**: Go to the **Main** tab and click **Move Now** to transfer files from the %%cache pool|cache-pool%% to the %%array|array%%.
4. **Verify the move**: After the %%Mover|mover%% finishes, check that the files have been moved by clicking the folder icon next to the cache entry on the **Main** tab.
5. **Re-enable Docker and %%VM|vm%% services**: Once all files are on the %%array|array%%, you can safely turn these services back on.
