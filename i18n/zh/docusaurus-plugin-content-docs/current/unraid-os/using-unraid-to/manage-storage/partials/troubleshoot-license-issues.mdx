:::tip
If you see an "invalid key" error, it might mean your trial has **expired**. To keep using Unraid, you can [purchase a license here](https://unraid.net/pricing).

:::caution[Blacklisted USB flash devices]
If your server is online and your trial hasn't run out, your USB flash drive might have a %%GUID|guid%% that can't register a key. This can happen if the %%GUID|guid%% isn't unique or has already registered by someone else. Using an SD card reader via USB can also cause this issue since it often has a generic %%GUID|guid%%. If your USB flash drive is **blacklisted**, it can't be used anymore, and you'll need to find a different device for your Unraid Server OS installation.
