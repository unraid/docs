A %%parity swap|parity-swap%% is a special procedure in Unraid used when you need to replace a data disk with a disk that is larger than your current parity disk. The process moves your current parity disk to the data slot, then installs a new, larger disk as the new parity disk. This ensures your array remains protected and allows for larger data drives in the future.
