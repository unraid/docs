如果您对命令行感到满意，使用此方法可以让您有更多的控制权，并且当 WebGUI 选项不可用时可能非常有用。有关使用命令行接口的更多信息，请参阅[命令行接口](../../../system-administration/advanced-tools/command-line-interface.mdx)。

:::note[Before 您开始]
- 确保您的池的 %%RAID|raid%% 配置支持设备移除；在 2 设备的 %%RAID 1|raid1%% 池中，必须先将其更改为单一配置以便移除设备。
- Check that remaining devices will have enough space for your data.
:::

To remove a disk using the command line:

1. **Open a terminal session**: Make sure the %%array|array%% is running and open your command line interface.

2. **Remove the device**: Type the command below, replacing `X` with the letter corresponding to the drive you want to remove (as shown in the Main tab):

   ```bash
   btrfs device remove /dev/sdX1 /mnt/cache
   ```

   - For encrypted devices, use: `/dev/mapper/sdX1`.
   - For NVMe devices, use: `nvmeXn1p1`.

3. **Wait for completion**: The device will be removed once you see the cursor return.

4. **Make Unraid "forget" the deleted member**:
   - 停止%%array|array%%。
   - Unassign all pool devices.
   - Start the %%array|array%% (Unraid will clear the pool configuration).
   - If any Docker/%%VM|vm%% services use this pool, disable them before starting the %%array|array%% to prevent Unraid from recreating images elsewhere.

5. **Reassign devices**: Stop the %%array|array%% again, reassign all remaining pool members except the removed device, and then start the %%array|array%%.

**To remove multiple devices**:

You can do so in one command:

```bash
btrfs device remove /dev/sdX1 /dev/sdY1 /mnt/cache
```

However, keep in mind that the removal will still occur one at a time.

:::note\[Timing]

Similar to the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% method, removing devices and rebalancing may take several hours depending on data volume and device speed.

:::

:::important
If you have only one device left in the pool, you will need to convert the %%RAID|raid%% profile to **single** to ensure everything functions correctly. For further instructions, refer to the section on [Switching the Pool RAID Level to Single](#changing-pool-raid-levels).
