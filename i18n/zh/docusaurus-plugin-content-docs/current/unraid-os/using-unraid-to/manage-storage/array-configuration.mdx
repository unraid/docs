# 阵列配置

Unraid 的存储系统通过结合 %%array|数组%% 和 %%cache|缓存%% 架构，实现灵活性与数据保护。%%array|数组%% 管理您的主要存储，提供可选 %%parity|校验%% 保护，而缓存池则加速性能。

以下是一些重要的阵列配置原则：

<details>
  <summary><strong>始终使用最大的驱动器用于校验。</strong></summary>

  当您稍后向%%array|array%%中添加更多磁盘时，请记住，数据磁盘的大小不能超过您的%%parity disks|parity-drives%%。一开始购买最大的硬盘用于%%parity disks|parity-drives%%是个不错的主意。这样，当您后续扩展时，不会受到较小存储容量的限制。

  如果您使用两个%%parity disks|parity-drives%%，它们可以是不同大小。但是，请记住，%%array|array%%中没有任何磁盘可以大于您所拥有的最小%%parity disks|parity-drives%%。
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>不要在阵列中使用SSD - 将它们用于缓存池或未分配设备。</strong></summary>

  Unraid does not support TRIM or Discard operations for SSDs in the main array. Over time, this will cause SSD performance to degrade if they are used as array members. For best results, use SSDs in %%cache pools|cache-pool%% or as unassigned devices, where these features are supported and long-term performance is maintained. Most modern SSDs, including NVMe, work well in these roles.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>使用缓存提高阵列写入性能。</strong></summary>

  数据不是直接写入主存储，而是首先发送到专用磁盘或磁盘组。此数据通常在凌晨3:40安排时间转移到主存储。伟大的事情是，保存到%%cache|cache%%的数据仍然通过%%user shares|user-share%%显示出来，因此您不需要更改访问文件的方式。
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>创建缓存池有助于保护缓存数据的安全。</strong></summary>

  仅使用一个缓存设备会使您的缓存数据在转移到主阵列之前面临风险。为了确保您的数据始终受到保护，使用多个设备配置为%%cache pool|cache-pool%%。这种设置为缓存数据提供冗余，降低由于缓存设备故障导致数据丢失的可能性。
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>SSD缓存设备非常适合应用程序和虚拟机。</strong></summary>

  使用SSD可以使应用程序和虚拟机（VM）运行更快，因为它们可以更快地访问数据。SSD在%%cache pool|cache-pool%%中表现良好，为您提供速度、效率和数据安全的出色组合。
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>加密默认关闭。</strong></summary>

  如果您想在系统上使用加密，必须使用加密文件系统类型重新格式化磁盘 - 这个过程会擦除驱动器上的所有现有数据。在启用加密之前，将数据移出磁盘，将文件系统更改为加密选项，格式化磁盘，然后将数据移回。详细信息，请参阅[如何在Unraid中加密驱动器](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/securing-your-data.mdx#how-to-encrypt-a-drive-in-unraid)。

  请记住，使用加密会导致数据恢复难度增加，因此仅在您真正需要时才使用它。

:::info[Disk 识别和端口灵活性]
Unraid identifies disks based on their serial numbers and sizes, not the specific SATA ports they're connected to. This means you can switch drives between different SATA ports without affecting their assignments in Unraid. This feature is particularly useful for troubleshooting hardware problems, like finding a faulty port or replacing unreliable power or SATA cables.
:::

:::caution
Your array will not start if you assign or attach more devices than your license key allows.
:::

## Start/Stop the array

When your system starts up, it usually powers up the array of disks automatically. However, if you've recently changed the disk setup, such as adding a new disk, the array will remain off to allow you to check your configuration.

:::caution
Keep in mind that you'll need to stop the array first to make any adjustments. Stopping it will fully stop all Docker containers and network shares, shut down or hibernate VMs, and your storage devices will be unmounted, making your data and applications inaccessible until you restart the array.
:::

To start or stop the array:

1. Click on the **Main** tab.
2. Navigate to the **Array Operation** section.
3. Click **Start** or **Stop**. You may need to check the box that says "Yes, I want to do this" before proceeding.

---

## Array operations

Unraid provides several maintenance and configuration options for your storage array. Key operations include:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

### Adding disks

#### Setting up new disks

1. Go to ***Main → Array Devices*** in the interface.
2. Pick the slot where you want to add the disk and select the disk from the dropdown list.
3. By default, new array drives will be formatted with %%XFS|xfs%%. If you want to use %%ZFS|zfs%% or %%BTRFS|btrfs%% instead, select your preferred file system from the drop-down menu.

:::tip[Hot-Swap Feature]
If you're using modern Unraid-compatible hardware, you can change disks without shutting down your server. This feature, known as hot-swap, has been available in LimeTech servers since the beginning.
:::

#### Clear vs. Pre-Clear

Unraid requires disks to be in a cleared state - completely filled with zeros and marked with a special signature - before adding them to a parity-protected array. This process ensures parity integrity and keeps the array online during disk preparation.

Clearance is mandatory when adding a data disk to a %%parity|parity%%-protected array. If you are adding a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% or working with an array that does not use %%parity|parity%%, clearance is not required.

The built-in clear operation writes zeros to the disk in the background, allowing the array to remain available. Once the process is complete, the disk must be formatted before use. This method is efficient, requires no third-party tools, and is ideal for quick expansions.

For a more thorough approach, the pre-clear operation – available through plugins like [Unassigned Devices Preclear](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=unassigned+devices#r:~:text=enable%20destructive%20mode.-,Unassigned%20Devices%20Preclear,-dlandon) – performs a pre-read to check for bad sectors, zeros the disk, and then verifies integrity with a post-read. This extra step helps detect early drive failures but takes significantly longer and requires manual plugin installation.

**Rule of thumb:** Use the built-in clear operation for fast additions to your array, or choose pre-clear if you want extensive testing of disk health before putting a drive into service.

<h4>Clear vs. Pre-Clear Comparison</h4>

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  |                  | Clear                       | Pre-Clear                               |
  | ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | **Purpose**      | Ensures basic compatibility | Tests the drive and prepares it for use |
  | **Speed**        | Works quickly               | Much slower process                     |
  | **Array Impact** | Runs in the background      | Needs the disk to be removed from use   |
  | **Best For**     | Ideal for quick expansions  | Great for checking new drives           |
</div>

**Clear** quickly prepares a disk for use, making it compatible with your system and allowing you to add storage in just a few hours.

**Pre-Clear** takes longer but provides a thorough test, ensuring a new disk is reliable before it becomes part of your array.

:::caution[Critical Note]
Avoid formatting a pre-cleared disk before including it in the array, as this removes the clearance signature.
:::

#### Adding data disks

Adding data disks is a great way to increase your Unraid array's storage space. By adding more disks, you can keep more files, applications, and backups, while still protecting your data.

:::important[Important Note:]
When adding a new data disk, it must be the same size or smaller than your current %%parity disks|parity-drives%%. If you want to use a larger disk, you'll need to replace the %%parity disks|parity-drives%% first with the larger one, then use the old %%parity disks|parity-drives%% as a data disk.
:::

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to add a data disk</strong></summary>

  ```mdx-code-block

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="standard" label="Standard addition (Parity-protected)" default>
      <AddDataDiskParityProtected />
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="no-parity" label="Addition without parity">
      <AddDataDiskNoParity />
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  ```
</details>

#### Adding parity disks

%%Parity disks|parity-drives%% are a helpful feature that provide an extra layer of protection for your data. They allow your storage system to recover information if a hard drive fails. While using %%parity disks|parity-drives%% is optional, it's highly recommended to keep your data safe.

:::important\[Requirements]

- **Single Parity:** The disk must be at least the same size as your largest data drive.
- **Dual Parity:** Both %%parity disks|parity-drives%% must also be at least the size of your largest data drive, but they can be different sizes from each other.

:::

Adding a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% is similar to adding a data disk, but there's one important step to keep in mind:

1. After you select the %%parity disk|parity-drives%% and start your storage array, a process called **parity calculation** begins.
2. While this process runs, you can still access your files. However, the system might run a bit slower because it's working to calculate the parity.

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: What is parity and why does it matter?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  %%Parity|parity%% in Unraid protects your data by ensuring that you can recover from a drive failure. With the use of a %%parity disk|parity-drives%%, any single missing disk can be reconstructed by combining the information from all other data drives along with the %%parity|parity%% data.

  Unraid relies on this real-time parity for two primary purposes:

  - Rebuilding data when a drive fails
  - Correcting errors when a bad sector is found

  This feature allows you to keep your data safe, even as drives will eventually fail over time.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: How does Unraid parity work?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Unraid works with a special bit called the *parity bit*, which is stored for each bit position across all data disks and is managed by a dedicated %%parity disk|parity-drives%%. The %%parity|parity%% is calculated such that the total number of bits in each position across all disks (including the %%parity disk|parity-drives%%) is always an even number, a process known as even parity.

  Here's how it breaks down:

  - Unraid uses the XOR (exclusive OR) operation for this calculation.
  - For example, if you have four drives, and their 57th bits are 1, 1, 1, 1, the parity bit for that position will be 0 (because 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = even).
  - However, if the 57th bits are 1, 0, 0, 0, the %%parity|parity%% for that position will be 1 (to ensure the total remains even).

  When adding a new drive, Unraid first clears it by writing zeros to all bits. This allows for quick inclusion into the protected array since writing zeros does not interfere with the current parity calculations.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: How is data reconstructed using parity?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Unraid can reconstruct a missing drive or repair a bad sector using the following steps:

  - It reads all remaining drives, including the %%parity disk|parity-drives%%.
  - It applies even %%parity|parity%% to solve for the missing data.

  For example, if drive 2 fails:

  - If the related bits are 1, 1, 1 (in addition to the %%parity|parity%%), Unraid calculates: 1 + x + 1 + 1 + 0 = even. Here, x must be 1 to maintain an even total.
  - If the bits show 1, x, 0, 0, 1 = even, then x will equal 0.

  This %%parity|parity%% feature allows Unraid to "simulate" the missing disk. You can continue using the array as if the drive were still functional. Once you install a new drive in the failed slot, Unraid will recreate all the missing data based on the current state of %%parity|parity%% and the other disks.

  To ensure ongoing protection and effective recovery, it's important to run regular %%parity checks|parity-check%%.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How big does my parity disk need to be?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Your %%parity disk|parity-drives%% must be **equal to or larger than your largest data disk**. For instance:

  - If your largest data disk is 10TB, your %%parity disk|parity-drives%% should be at least 10TB.
  - You can use various other data disk sizes freely, as long as none exceeds the size of the %%parity disk|parity-drives%%.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: How does parity affect write performance?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Writing to a %%parity|parity%%-protected array involves four disk operations for each write: reading data, reading %%parity|parity%%, writing data, and writing %%parity|parity%%. This process requires a full rotation from each affected drive, so the overall write speed is limited by the slowest drive involved in the operation.

  Adding a faster %%parity disk|parity-drives%% won't necessarily improve write speeds unless you're writing to multiple slow data disks simultaneously, allowing the %%parity disk|parity-drives%% to handle the load. Typically, the write speed is constrained by the slowest data drive being written to.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: How does Dual Parity work?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Dual %%parity|parity%% enables recovery from **two simultaneous disk failures**. In Unraid, the second %%parity disk|parity-drives%% doesn't simply mirror the first. Instead:

  - **Parity 1:** Employs standard XOR (even) %%parity|parity%% calculations.
  - **Parity 2:** Utilizes a more complex algorithm (Galois field, rather than Reed-Solomon as in traditional %%RAID 6|raid6%%), allowing Unraid to rebuild from any two missing disks at the same time. This feature is significant for larger arrays, where the risk of multiple failures increases. Dual %%parity|parity%% significantly boosts resilience without the added overhead of mirrored redundancy.
</details>

:::caution\[Remember]

When setting up a new data storage system, add your data disks **first**, making sure they all use a compatible file system. **After** placing your data disks, you can add a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% to protect against drive failures.

Once your %%parity disk|parity-drives%% is added, remember that any new disk you want to include in the array must be cleared (zeroed) before it's integrated. This is to ensure that the %%parity|parity%% remains valid and continues to protect your data.

:::

#### 升级奇偶校验磁盘

您可以将%%parity disk|parity-drives%%设备升级到更大以便在阵列中使用更大尺寸的磁盘或添加额外的%%parity disk|parity-drives%%。

:::caution
If you're planning to take the following steps and only have one %%parity disk|parity-drives%%, keep these points in mind:

- 在%%parity|parity%%重建完成之前，您的数据将没有保护。如果数据磁盘在此期间故障，您可能会丢失那块磁盘上的信息。
- If you already have a data drive that has failed, proceeding with these steps will prevent you from being able to rebuild that drive. In this case, you should follow the **Parity Swap** procedure instead.
:::

要移除奇偶校验驱动器：

1. **停止阵列：** 使用%%WebGUI|web-gui%%停止阵列。

:::tip
如果您的服务器支持热插拔，更换磁盘时不需要关机。您可以安全地跳过步骤2和步骤4。
:::

2. **关闭服务器：** 关闭服务器以安全地进行硬件更改。
3. **安装新的%%parity disk|parity-drives%%：** 将新的、更大的%%parity disk|parity-drives%%放入您的服务器中。
4. **启动服务器：** 重新打开服务器。
5. **分配新磁盘：** 进入设置中的校验槽分配新磁盘，替换旧磁盘。
6. **启动阵列：** 使用%%WebGUI|web-gui%%重新启动阵列。

一旦阵列恢复，Unraid 将开始在新磁盘上构建 %%parity|校验%%。在此期间，您仍可以访问您的数据，但请注意，在过程完成之前，访问速度可能会有些慢。一旦 %%parity|校验%% 构建完成，您的数据将再次得到保护！

:::important[Important 提示]
- **保留旧磁盘：** 在新的%%parity|parity%%构建完成之前，不要移除旧的%%parity disk|parity-drives%%。如果在升级过程中数据磁盘出现故障，保留旧磁盘可能有助于您恢复数据。

- \*\*双重校验用户：\*\*如果您有两个%%parity disks|parity-drives%%，请一次升级一个以增加安全性。

- **Repurpose the old disk:** After the upgrade, you can use the old %%parity disk|parity-drives%% as a data disk if it still meets your storage needs.
:::

### 更换磁盘

您可能会需要因以下两个主要原因来更换阵列中的磁盘：

1. [**容量升级**](#upgrading-capacity)：您的存储空间接近满载，您希望使用更大的磁盘。
2. [**故障或退役**](#replacing-faileddisabled-disks)：某个磁盘已故障或不再支持。

虽然两种情况下更换磁盘的过程相似，但请注意，替换过程中存在数据丢失的风险。校验设备可以保护您的数据；一个校验设备可以防止单个磁盘故障导致的数据丢失，而两个设备可以在两个磁盘故障情况下保护数据。更换磁盘时，请始终了解您的保护级别。

#### 升级容量

在将数据驱动器升级为更大的驱动器时，请注意以下几点：

- **不可挂载的磁盘：** 在升级之前修复任何不可挂载的磁盘。不可挂载状态在重建期间不会被解决。

- **单个校验的风险：** 如果您只有单个校验，在升级期间如果另一个驱动器发生故障，您将面临数据丢失的风险。如果发生这种情况，请在论坛中寻求建议。

- **双校验保护：** 通过双校验，如果在升级单个驱动器时一个驱动器出现故障，您可以放心，不会丢失数据。您还可以同时升级两个驱动器，但请注意这会增加风险，因为您将没有另一驱动器故障的保护。

- **备份旧磁盘：** 在确认升级成功之前，保持原磁盘完好无损。这为出现任何问题时提供了回退选项。

:::warning
更换驱动器总是涉及到一定的风险。如果在升级期间另一块驱动器故障，特别是只有单一校验的情况下，您可能会丢失数据。在开始之前务必检查驱动器的健康状况，并确保在升级完成并确认数据安全之前保持旧驱动器完整无损。
:::

要升级现有数据磁盘：

1. **运行一个校验检查：** 首先，通过运行 %%parity check|校验检查%% 确保数据的完整性。前往[***工具 → 校验检查***](#checking-array-devices)并确保没有**错误**。如果校验无效，重建磁盘将破坏其文件系统。

2. **停止阵列：**接下来，您需要停止阵列。导航到***主菜单 → 阵列操作***并选择**停止**。

3. **取消分配目标磁盘：** 一旦阵列停止，找到要替换的磁盘。将其从***主菜单 → 阵列设备***中的插槽中移除。

4. **启动阵列：** 现在，再次启动阵列。Unraid 将使用现有的校验和数据磁盘来模拟丢失的磁盘。您可以选择两种模式：
   - **维护模式：** 此模式可防止任何写入到%%emulated disk|emulated-disk%%。
   - **正常模式：** 如果您需要对%%emulated disk|emulated-disk%%进行读/写访问，请选择此选项。

:::note
在此时以正常模式启动阵列是可选的。您可以用它来验证是否可以挂载模拟磁盘且数据看起来正确，然后继续，但这不是升级过程所必需的。
:::

5. **再次停止阵列：** 阵列现在应该显示未分配的磁盘已经失败。再次停止阵列。

6. **分配替换的磁盘：** 将新的更大磁盘插入阵列中的空余插槽。

7. **启动阵列以重建：** 最后，再次启动阵列。Unraid 现在会将 %%emulated disk|模拟磁盘%% 的内容重建到新磁盘上。文件系统将自动调整以充分利用更大磁盘的容量。

#### 更换故障/禁用磁盘

<details>
  <summary><strong>什么是故障/禁用磁盘？</strong></summary>

  A failed or disabled disk is one that Unraid has stopped using for writing data, usually because it encountered a write error. Keep in mind these don't always mean the drive itself is broken; sometimes, it might be due to bad connections, power issues, or just a temporary glitch.

  一些指示包括：

  <div class="text--center">

    :::

    :::重要
    如果您遇到了**超过校验保护能力的磁盘损坏:**

    1. **立即停止所有写操作**以防止进一步的数据丢失。
    2. 通过在[Unraid 论坛](https://forums.unraid.net/)发帖并附上诊断信息寻求帮助。
    3. **在收到建议之前不要尝试重建** - 首先关注数据的抢救。

  <summary><strong>如何诊断问题</strong></summary>

  要诊断问题，请从检查%%syslog|syslog%%和%%SMART报告|smart-report%%开始：

  - 如果%%syslog|syslog%%显示磁盘已重置，可能是连接或电缆有问题。
  - %%SMART报告|smart-report%%可以评估驱动器的健康状态，但最好通过运行%%SMART|smart%%扩展测试来检查。如果测试没有错误，则驱动器可能是正常的。
  - 如果看到 %%CRC errors|CRC 错误%%，通常意味着电缆问题。注意这些错误，它们会随着时间的推移积累且不会重置。

  :::tip
  要了解驱动器问题，[启用通知](../../getting-started/set-up-unraid/customize-unraid-settings.mdx#notification-settings)在Unraid中。这样，一旦出现问题，您就会立即得到警报，从而降低数据风险。
  :::
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>什么是模拟？</strong></summary>

  When a drive is disabled, Unraid will use its parity and other working drives to emulate the failed drive. This means your system continues to operate, and you can still access the data stored on the %%emulated drive|emulated-disk%%:

  - Unraid 将停止写入物理磁盘，任何更新将会保存在校验和仿真中。
  - 在更换故障驱动之前，您可以检查并从%%emulated drive|emulated-disk%%恢复数据，这将使物理磁盘保持完整以便潜在恢复。
  - 如果无法访问 %%emulated drive|模拟盘%%，在任何重建之前修复文件系统是必要的，因为修复文件系统比重建更快更有效。
</details>

  A failed or disabled disk is one that Unraid has stopped using for writing data, usually because it encountered a write error. Keep in mind these don't always mean the drive itself is broken; sometimes, it might be due to bad connections, power issues, or just a temporary glitch.

  虽然不是强制性的，许多用户选择预清理新驱动器以测试它们并帮助防止早期故障。您可以使用Preclear插件、%%SMART|smart%%延伸测试或制造商工具来执行此操作。

  :::小心
  如果您试图使用不可挂载的%%emulated drive|emulated-disk%%进行重建，新驱动器也将无法挂载。在尝试重建之前务必修复文件系统。

如果您的 Unraid 系统中的磁盘出现故障或被禁用，不要担心！您可以更换它并恢复数据。只需按照这些简单的步骤。记住，您需要一个相同大小或更大的新磁盘，但它不能比您最小的 %%parity disk|校验盘%% 大。

:::important
在开始之前，请确保检查是否有任何磁盘错误或警告。Unraid 必须能够读取所有剩余磁盘并无任何问题地进行重建。如果另一个磁盘出现故障，可能会导致数据丢失。
:::

替换和重建磁盘：

1. **停止阵列：**

   - 登录 Unraid WebGUI（网页界面）。
   - 找选项停止阵列，这是更换任何磁盘之前的必要步骤。

:::tip
如果您的服务器支持热插入，您可以跳过下一步，只需停止阵列。
:::

2. **关闭服务器电源**（仅在**不**使用热插拔时）：
   - 如果您的服务器不支持热插拔，您需要完全关闭它。

3. **更换故障磁盘：**
   - 从服务器中移除旧的故障磁盘。
   - 插入新磁盘。请记住，它必须至少与旧磁盘一样大，但不能大于您最小的 %%parity disk|校验盘%%。

4. **启动服务器**（如果您已将其关闭）：
   - 如果您已关闭服务器，则重新打开它。

5. **分配新磁盘：**
   - 返回到 Unraid WebGUI。
   - 找到故障磁盘的槽位，并将新磁盘分配到该槽位。

6. **确认您的操作：**
   - 勾选“是，我想这么做”的选项并确认。

7. **（可选）选择%%维护模式|maintenance-mode%%：**
   - 您可以选择%%维护模式|maintenance-mode%%，这可以加快重建过程。但是，在此期间您将无法访问阵列。
   - 如果选择了%%维护模式|maintenance-mode%%，请确保点击**同步**以开始重建。

8. **开始重建：**
   - 点击**启动**开始过程。Unraid 会将数据从 %%emulated disk|模拟磁盘%% 复制到新磁盘。
   - 如果您的新磁盘更大，Unraid 将为您管理额外的空间。

:::warning
如果 Unraid 在重建期间提示您格式化新磁盘，请**不要这样做**。格式化将清除所有数据，使恢复不可能。
:::

<h4>重建期间的期望</h4>

- 在重建过程中（除非您处于 %%Maintenance Mode|维护模式%%），此阵列仍可用，但它可能会运行得更慢。
- 重建可能需要几个小时，具体取决于您的磁盘大小和系统使用情况。
- 新磁盘将具有与原始磁盘相同的文件系统。
- 如果旧磁盘由于文件系统问题而无法挂载，新的磁盘也将无法挂载。请在开始重建之前修复任何文件系统问题。

:::note[Additional 笔记]
- 重建过程不会改变磁盘的文件格式；它只是恢复其先前的形式。
- Always check the health of every disk before you start a rebuild to avoid any potential issues.

<details>
  <summary><strong>示例场景</strong></summary>

  您有一个 Unraid 设置，其中有一个**2TB 校验盘**和一个**1TB 数据盘**，并希望将 1TB 磁盘换成**4TB 磁盘**。

  首先，将新4TB驱动器分配为校验驱动器，以替换2TB驱动器。然后将原始的2TB驱动器移动到数据槽，并完全移除1TB驱动器。

  经过这些更改后，您将拥有一个4TB驱动器作为新校验，以确保可以添加未来最大至4TB的数据驱动器。2TB驱动器将存储现有数据，而1TB驱动器可以重新分配用途。

  这种交换保持您的数据安全并保护您的阵列，允许将来进行升级。
</details>

:::important\[Prerequisites]

- 在开始之前，请确保要替换的数据驱动器已被禁用。若驱动器故障（显示红色指示器），则已禁用。如果驱动器健康但您想替换它，请取消分配该驱动器并在没有它的情况下启动阵列一次，以迫使 Unraid 将其标记为已禁用。
- 如果您的更换数据磁盘不大于您的校验盘，请使用标准的[更换数据磁盘](#replacing-faileddisabled-disks)程序。
- This procedure is only needed for replacing data drives in an Unraid array with a disk larger than the current parity drive. If you only need to upgrade your parity drive, simply remove the old parity drive, add the new one, and start the array. Parity will rebuild automatically.

:::

:::warning\[Warnings]

- 在开始 %%parity swap|校验交换%% 之前，总是使用 %%SMART reports|SMART 报告%% 验证所有驱动器的健康状况。尝试在另一个故障或不健康的磁盘上进行此过程会增加数据丢失的风险。
- 如果可能，请预清理新磁盘。尽管不需要，但预清理可以对磁盘进行压力测试并减少早期失效的风险。
- Correctly identify all drives before beginning. Note the model numbers and last four characters of each serial number to avoid mistakes during assignment.

执行奇偶校验交换：

:::note
如果要替换的驱动器已禁用（故障），您可能不需要执行步骤1–4。如果您已经安装了新的替换驱动器（例如，预清理后），您可以跳过步骤5–8。
:::

1. **停止阵列**，如果它正在运行。
2. **卸载旧数据驱动器**，如果仍然分配。如果该磁盘之前正常，您可能会看到缺少磁盘的错误通知—这是预期的。
3. **启动阵列。** 如果收到提示，勾选框确认操作。数据驱动器现在应显示为“未安装”。
4. \*\*再次停止阵列。\*\*此时，阵列将磁盘视为已失效。
5. **关闭服务器电源。**

   :::tip

### 移除磁盘

有可能您想从 Unraid 阵列中移除一个磁盘。无论您是想节约电力，退役一个旧的或不可靠的驱动器，还是将硬件重新用于其他用途，此过程都相对简单。

#### 移除校验盘

如果您发现不再需要设置中的 %%parity|校验%% 保护级别，可以随时移除 %%parity disk|校验盘%%。

移除 %%parity drives|校验盘%%：

1. \*\*停止阵列：\*\*开始通过访问%%WebGUI|web-gui%%并停止阵列。
2. **取消分配 %%parity drives|校验盘%%：** 找到 %%parity drives|校验盘%% 槽位并将其设置为“未分配”。
3. **启动阵列：** 最后，重启阵列以提交更改，并成功地从配置中移除 %%parity drives|校验盘%%。

:::warning
Before you make any changes, please keep this in mind: If you already have any failed data drives in your array, removing a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% can decrease the number of failures Unraid can handle without risking data loss.

- 使用双重校验可以从单个失效驱动器中恢复，但请注意，在重建过程中，您将无法承受另一次故障。
- With single parity, you lose all redundancy, meaning that any additional drive failures could result in data loss.
:::

#### 移除数据磁盘

移除数据磁盘是一个简便的过程，但请记住，之后需要执行 %%parity|校验%% 同步。在此同步完成之前，如果另一个磁盘故障，将有数据丢失的风险。

您可以选择两种方法来移除数据磁盘：

1. **标准方法** - 推荐大多数用户使用。
2. **保留校验方法** - 适合希望在移除过程中保持校验的高级用户。

```mdx-code-block

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="standard" label="Standard method" default>
    <RemoveDataDiskStandard />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="parity-preserve" label="Parity-preserve method (Advanced)">
    <RemoveDataDiskParityPreserve />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

---

### 检查阵列设备

定期检查您的 Unraid 阵列对于维护数据完整性和识别潜在问题至关重要。在潜在问题导致数据丢失之前，您可以在 ***阵列操作*** 下使用 **检查** 按钮发起检查。根据您的阵列配置，此按钮可让您进行 %%parity check|校验检查%% 或 %%read check|读检查%%。

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![检查按钮可让您进行校验和读取检查](/img/Check_button.PNG)
</div>

为方便起见，您可以通过导航至***设置→计划程序***按适合您的间隔自动安排这些检查。建议每月或每季度执行自动、非校正检查，以确保数据的持续健康。

#### 奇偶校验 & 读取检查

```mdx-code-block

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="parity-check" label="Parity checks" default>
    <ArrayCheckParity />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="read-check" label="Read checks">
    <ArrayCheckRead />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

#### 检查历史

每当系统执行 %%parity check|校验检查%% 或 %%read check|读检查%% 时，它会记录所发生的情况。您可以通过点击界面的 ***阵列操作*** 下的 **历史** 按钮轻松查看这些详细信息。

如果想深入挖掘，所有这些记录都保存在您的 Unraid USB 闪存设备的 `config` 目录下的文本文件中。

### 磁盘升降速操作

Unraid 允许您控制硬盘的电源状态。您可以轻松地 %%spin them up or down|电源状态%%，并管理 SSD 处于活动或待机状态。这有助于省电，延长硬盘寿命，并在磁盘未使用时降低噪音。

<h4>为什么要启动或停止？</h4>

- \*\*停止（Spin down）：\*\*如果您有不常用的驱动器，停止它们可以节省能源并延长寿命。
- \*\*启动（Spin up）：\*\*如果您知道很快将需要文件，提前启动磁盘可以减少等待时间。

<h4>如何控制启动状态</h4>

您可以通过%%WebGUI|web-gui%%的**主**选项卡来控制磁盘的旋转状态：

1. **转到主标签**并找到您的阵列设备。
2. **找到启动控制按钮**-每个磁盘会显示：
   - 点击🔘按钮以 **启动** 如果磁盘当前处于停止状态
   - 点击🟢按钮以 **停止** 如果磁盘当前正在旋转
3. **点击合适的按钮**进行您所需的操作：
   - 点击 **停止** 🟢 以关闭空闲磁盘并节省能源
   - 点击 **启动** 🔘 以启动当前处于停止状态的磁盘

请记住，如果磁盘被访问（例如打开文件），它将保持活动并忽略任何停止请求。

当磁盘不转时，其温度将不会在%%WebGUI|web-gui%%中显示。然而，一旦任何应用程序或用户访问它，它将自动开始转动。

:::tip
使用旋转控制来节省电力并减少对驱动器的损耗。请记住，正在被使用的磁盘将保持开启状态，直到所有任务完成。
:::

---

### 重置阵列配置

重置阵列配置是一个需要谨慎对待的重要步骤。此过程通常在移除磁盘、以新阵列布局重头开始或修复磁盘分配问题时是必要的。请注意，此操作可能会影响数据保护和校验，因此请确保只有在确有必要时才继续进行。

重置阵列的常见原因包括：

- \*\*删除或替换磁盘：\*\*如果您需要移除或更换阵列中的任何磁盘。
- \*\*重新开始：\*\*当您希望为阵列创建全新的布局时。
- \*\*修复磁盘分配错误：\*\*解决当前磁盘分配的任何问题。
- \*\*从配置问题中恢复：\*\*面临现有设置挑战时。

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '650px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![重置磁盘配置可以通过新配置页面完成](/img/Newconfig.png)
</div>

要重置阵列配置：

1. 转到**工具**页面并点击**新配置**。
2. 如果您只希望进行一些小的调整，可以保留一些现有的磁盘分配。这可以节省时间并将错误的几率减小。
3. 通过勾选框确认您的选择，然后点击**应用**。
4. 应用更改后，您的配置将被重置。
5. 通过适当地分配或取消分配磁盘做出任何必要的配置更改。
6. 启动阵列于正常或维护模式以完成更新。

:::important
- **数据保护：** Unraid 会尽可能识别先前使用的驱动器并保护数据。
- \*\*对校验的影响：\*\*移除数据驱动器将始终使校验无效，除非在移除之前清零该驱动器。
- **Disk reordering:** Changing the order of disks won't affect parity1, but it *can* invalidate parity2.
:::

:::caution
When you see the **Start** button, there is a checkbox labeled **Parity is Valid**. Only check this box if you are certain it is correct or if an experienced Unraid user has advised you to do so during recovery. Incorrectly checking this option can lead to data loss.

Do not use **New Config** if your goal is to rebuild a disk. Performing a New Config clears the array history required for a rebuild, and Unraid will not offer to rebuild the disk afterward. Follow the disk rebuild procedure instead.
:::

#### 撤销重置

如果您需要撤销重置：

1. 通过网络 (SMB) 访问您的闪存设备。
2. 找到并打开 `config` 文件夹。
3. 将文件 `super.old` 重命名为 `super.dat`。
4. 重启您的服务器，之前的阵列配置应得到恢复。

---

### 状态报告

Unraid 提供状态报告，帮助您跟踪存储阵列的健康状况。这些报告是快速检查任何磁盘是否禁用或在读取或写入数据时出现问题的快捷方式。

- \*\*当前状态：\*\*状态报告显示您的阵列当前情况。重要的是要注意，这些信息在系统重新启动后将被重置，因此不会保留过去的历史问题。

- \*\*无历史数据：\*\*如果您想查看重启前发生了什么，您需要去其它地方查看，因为这些报告不保存过去的状态。

:::important
请记住，状态报告不包括%%SMART|smart%%数据。%%SMART报告|smart-report%%为您提供了单个磁盘健康的更详细视图。因此，即使您的状态报告显示一切正常，定期检查%%SMART报告|smart-report%%以尽早发现任何潜在问题仍然是个好主意。
:::

## 阵列写入模式

Unraid 提供多种写入模式用于管理阵列操作，每种模式在速度、电量消耗和磁盘损耗方面各有优劣。了解这些模式的工作原理以及缓存盘或缓存池的作用，有助于根据您的需求优化服务器。

**写入模式概览**

| 写入模式            | 速度（典型）                                  | 能耗   | 何时驱动器启动   | 数据保护    | 最佳使用场景                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 读/修改/写          | 20–40 MB/s                              | 低    | 仅校验和目标驱动器 | Yes     | 大多数工作负载，节能，小写入                       |
| Turbo Write（重建） | 40–120 MB/s                             | High | 所有驱动器     | Yes     | 大文件传输, 阵列重建, %%parity checks\|校验检查%% |
| 缓存写入（SSD/NVMe）  | 50–110 MB/s (SSD)，250–900 MB/s (NVMe)\* | 变化   | 仅缓存驱动器    | 否（直到移动） | 应用，虚拟机，频繁写入，最大化速度                    |

<h3>读取/修改/写入</h3>

<details>
  <summary>点击展开/折叠</summary>

  <h4>它是如何工作的</h4>
  该模式读取现有数据和校验，计算新的校验，然后写入更新的数据。只有%%parity drive|parity-drives%%和目标数据驱动器与之旋转，从而降低了功耗和驱动器磨损。然而，由于额外的读/写循环，可能会较慢。

  <h4>使用时机</h4>

  - 随时，尤其是当您想节省能源并让空闲驱动器停止时。
  - 非常适合小型或不频繁的写入。
</details>

<h3>Turbo Write（重建写入）</h3>

<details>
  <summary>点击展开/折叠</summary>

  Turbo write, also known as reconstruct write, is a feature designed to boost the writing speed of your Unraid array. It works by reading all data drives and updating the parity simultaneously. This process eliminates the delays caused by waiting for the platters to rotate, as seen in the default write mode. However, it's important to note that all array drives need to be spinning and functioning properly for this to work effectively.

  <h4>原理</h4>

  - 当您写入新数据时，Unraid 会读取所有其他数据驱动器并同时重新计算校验。新数据和更新的校验会同时写入。
  - 阵列中的所有驱动器都必须是操作正常并积极旋转的。
  - 这一方法大大提高了写入速度，与默认写入模式相比。

  <h4>什么时候使用Turbo Write</h4>

  - 在将大文件传输到阵列时使用Turbo write。
  - 在数组重建或%%parity checks|parity-check%%期间很有效，因为所有驱动器都会旋转。
  - 当减少写入时间是优先考虑的并且可以确认所有驱动器健康时，此模式非常有用。

  <h4>什么时候避免使用Turbo Write</h4>

  - 如果你希望驱动器在空闲时间停止以节省能量，避免使用此模式。
  - Turbo写入不适合小型或不频繁的写入操作，因为它会导致每次写入时所有驱动器旋转，增加了功耗和驱动磨损。
  - 如果你怀疑任何驱动器发生故障或不可靠，最好避开turbo write，因为它依赖于每个驱动器正常运行。

  :::信息
  Turbo写入最适合大宗操作和需要高吞吐量的场景。然而，如果您关注节能和最小化驱动器磨损，它可能不是日常任务的最佳选择。
  :::
</details>

<h3>缓存写入</h3>

<details>
  <summary>点击展开/折叠</summary>

  <h4>原理</h4>

  数据首先写入快速SSD或NVMe %%cache|cache%%，然后通过称为%%Mover|mover%%的过程移动到主阵列。速度可变：

  - SSD：50–110 MB/s
  - NVMe：250–900 MB/s（可以利用10GbE网络）

  一旦数据被移动到阵列，其受到校检保护。

  <h4>使用缓存写入的时机</h4>

  - 对于应用、虚拟机或下载等频繁写入的共享。
  - 提升性能并减少任何感知的写入延迟。

  <h4>性能预期</h4>

  - 没有缓存驱动：平均20–30 MB/s，峰值达40 MB/s。
  - 使用SSD缓存：50–110 MB/s。
  - 使用NVMe缓存：250–900 MB/s，取决于网络或驱动限制。

  :::tip
  在%%Mover|mover%%运行之前，请考虑使用缓存池（多个设备）以增加冗余和数据保护。
  :::
</details>

:::info[Automated 解决方案]
- **自动**模式（未来功能）将仅在所有驱动器已旋转时启用turbo写入。
- Community plugins (search for "Turbo Write" in the Apps tab) may offer enhanced automation or scheduling options.
:::

更改写入模式：

1. 导航到 ***设置→磁盘设置***。
2. 定位 **可调项（md\_写入\_方法）**。
3. 选择您喜欢的模式：
   - **读/修改/写** (默认)
   - **重建写入** (Turbo Write)
   - **自动** (未来功能)
4. 点击**应用**以确认您的选择。

:::important[Quick 回顾]
- 当你需要速度时使用 **Turbo Write**，但要注意增加的功耗和驱动启动。
- 使用 **缓存写入**以获得最佳性能，特别是在使用SSD或NVMe驱动器时。
- For most users, the default write mode offers the best balance unless you specifically need higher speeds.
:::

## 读取模式

使用 Unraid 时，读取文件的速度主要由存储每个文件的单独驱动器决定。与传统 %%RAID|硬盘冗余数组%% 系统不同，Unraid 是将每个文件存储在单个磁盘上。这意味着读取速度不会由于组合多个驱动器的速度而提高。

<h3>性能期望</h3>

- **典型单个HDD：** 70–250 MB/s（取决于驱动型号、年龄和数据位置）
- **典型SATA SSD：** 400–550 MB/s
- **NVMe SSD（在池中）：** 250–7,000 MB/s（受PCIe代和网络/PCIe限制影响；例如，10GbE网络限制约1,100 MB/s）

:::note[Special 案例]
- 如果磁盘被禁用且其数据正在重建，Unraid 将使用剩余的磁盘和校验信息重建数据。此过程中，读取速度可能会变慢到 30–60 MB/s 甚至更低，具体取决于系统中最慢的驱动器。
- Any ongoing operations in the array, such as a %%parity check|parity-check%% or rebuilding a drive, can also affect read performance. This is due to increased movement of the drive heads and overall contention for resources.
:::

## 缓存池

Unraid 中的 %%Cache pools|缓存池%% 为写重任务，虚拟机（VMs）和 Docker 容器提供显著优势。这些池独立于主阵列运行，可以使用 %%BTRFS|BTRFS 文件系统%% 或 %%ZFS|ZFS 文件系统%% 设置多个驱动器，支持多种 %%RAID|硬盘冗余数组%% 配置以提高速度和数据保护。

<h3>缓存池与主阵列对比</h3>

\*实际NVMe速度取决于PCIe代、散热和网络带宽（例如10GbE上限约为\~1,100 MB/s）。\*

<h4>缓存池的优点</h4>

- \*\*更高性能：\*\*NVMe池可以饱和10GbE/40GbE网络（1,100–3,500 MB/s）。
- **灵活的RAID：** %%BTRFS|btrfs%% 和 %%ZFS|zfs%%均支持%%RAID 1|raid1%%/%%RAID 10|raid10%%，以实现冗余而无需匹配驱动器大小。
- \*\*低延迟：\*\*非常适合数据库、VMs和Docker容器。
- **ZFS优势：**%%ZFS|zfs%%提供企业级功能，如数据完整性检查、压缩和快照。

<h4>缓存池的缺点</h4>

- \*\*无奇偶校验保护：\*\*在移动到数组之前，数据未受保护。
- **恢复风险：** %%BTRFS|btrfs%% %%RAID 5|raid5%%/%%RAID 6|raid6%%不稳定；单驱动器池缺乏冗余。
- **ZFS考虑因素：**%%ZFS|zfs%%需要更多的RAM，并且硬件要求比%%BTRFS|btrfs%%更严格。

### 重建期间的磁盘故障

如果在重建另一个磁盘时发生第二个磁盘故障，您能做的将取决于您的奇偶校验设置。

<h4>单 %%parity disk|校验盘%%</h4>

如果在重建另一个磁盘时一个磁盘故障，重建将停止，因为数据无法准确恢复。

<h4>双 %%parity disk|校验盘%%</h4>

如果您有两个 %%parity drives|校验盘%%，您有更多的选择：

- 您可以等待第一个重建完成，然后再处理第二个故障磁盘。
- 或者，您可以停止当前重建，替换第二个故障磁盘，然后启动阵列以同时重建两个磁盘。

如果第一次重建快要完成，通常最好让它完成。如果刚开始，重建两个可能会更快。

:::warning
重建磁盘会给所有驱动器带来很大压力，从而增加新故障的概率。在开始重建前，请使用%%SMART报告|smart-report%%检查磁盘健康。
:::

:::info[Rebuild 时间]
要准备好重建过程可能需要几个小时。时间可能因磁盘大小和系统忙碌程度而异。较大的磁盘和繁忙的系统可能需要更长时间。
:::
