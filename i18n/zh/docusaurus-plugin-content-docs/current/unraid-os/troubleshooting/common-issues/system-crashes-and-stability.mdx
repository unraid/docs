# System crashes & stability

System crashes and stability issues can be tough to diagnose and resolve. They often come from hardware failures, configuration mistakes, or conflicts within software. This section will guide you through common causes, diagnostic steps, and best practices to help keep your Unraid server stable.

---

## RAM issues

Memory problems are among the most common causes of system instability and data corruption. RAM can wear out over time, leading to unpredictable errors that are often difficult to diagnose. This section covers how to identify and resolve memory-related stability issues.

Common symptoms of RAM problems include:

- Unexplained system crashes or freezes
- Data corruption in files or %%array|array%%
- Random application errors
- System instability under load
- Failed %%parity checks|parity-check%%

### Testing RAM

Memory testing is essential for diagnosing stability issues. The Unraid boot menu includes Memtest86+ for comprehensive RAM testing, which works on both Legacy and %%UEFI|uefi%% systems.

To test your RAM:

1. Restart your server and select **Memtest86+** from the boot menu.
2. Let the test run for at least 2-4 hours for thorough coverage.
3. Monitor for any error messages or failed tests.

:::important[If you find RAM errors]
If Memtest86+ shows errors, try reseating the RAM modules and rerunning the test. Test each RAM stick individually to pinpoint faulty modules. Refer to your motherboard documentation for supported RAM speeds and configurations, and avoid mixing different RAM brands or speeds to minimize compatibility issues.
:::

### Overclocking RAM

RAM overclocking can significantly impact system stability. Many users want to run their RAM at the highest speed specified by the manufacturer, but motherboard and CPU combinations often have maximum reliable RAM speeds that are lower than what the RAM is rated for.

:::caution[RAM overclocking risks and recommendations]

**Intel XMP and AMD AMP profiles are overclocks.** For the best stability, always run RAM at SPD speeds, not XMP/AMP speeds.

**Risks of overclocking:**

- System instability and random crashes
- Data corruption and file system errors
- Reduced hardware lifespan
- Incompatibility with other components

\*\*故障排除：\*\*如果 Memtest86+ 测试通过但您仍遇到问题，禁用 XMP/AMP 并重试。性能差异通常很小，但稳定性改进可能显著。
:::

<h4>Best practices</h4>

1. Always check your motherboard and CPU specifications before attempting to overclock.
2. **For maximum stability:** Disable XMP/AMP profiles and run RAM at default SPD speeds.
3. Start with conservative settings and gradually increase.
4. Test stability with Memtest86+ after any changes.
5. If you notice instability, immediately revert to default or lower speeds.
6. Consider the trade-off between performance and stability for server environments.

## Critical stability factors

  2. **Critical:** Ensure your power supply can handle simultaneous spin-up of ALL attached storage devices. The 12V rail current rating must account for the spin-up current of all drives at once, not staggered.
  3. Avoid power splitters whenever possible. They can cause voltage drops and instability, especially during high-current events like drive spin-up.
  4. Consider redundant power supplies for enterprise and multi-bay systems.
  5. Ensure each PSU unit is properly seated and connected.
  6. Monitor PSU health indicators (like AC OK LEDs) if available.
  7. Replace failed units immediately to avoid downtime.
  8. Regularly check that all power cords are secure.
  9. Verify circuits are not overloaded.
