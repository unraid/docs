At the console or via %%SSH|ssh%%, run:

```
xfs_repair -v /dev/mdXp1
```

Replace **X** with the correct disk number (e.g., `md1p1` for Disk 1).

- Review the repair report for further remediation steps if required. If only minor issues, running `-v` is generally sufficient.
- If repair produces a `lost+found` directory, review and manage as above.
- %%Parity|parity%% is maintained during the repair.
- When finished, stop the %%array|array%% and restart in normal mode.
