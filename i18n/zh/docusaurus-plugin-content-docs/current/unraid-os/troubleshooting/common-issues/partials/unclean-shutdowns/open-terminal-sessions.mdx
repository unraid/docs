Unraid waits for all open terminal or SSH sessions to close during shutdown. If these sessions remain active and the shutdown timer expires, a forced shutdown occurs.

:::tip
The [Dynamix Stop Shell](https://unraid.net/community/apps/c/tools-system/p2?srsltid=AfmBOoqBXyDNfHxRDCL7Fv9Gcfz8-8CdHmiJSX16PRZpZLLzgQtw2mVk#:~:text=the%20given%20interval.-,Dynamix%20Stop%20Shell,-Dynamix%20Repository) plugin can automatically close lingering bash or SSH sessions, helping ensure a graceful shutdown. However, be cautious if there are ongoing write operations to the %%array|array%%.
