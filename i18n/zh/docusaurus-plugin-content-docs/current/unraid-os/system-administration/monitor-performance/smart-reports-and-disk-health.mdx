# SMART 报告及磁盘健康

**Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (%%SMART|smart%%)** is a helpful feature in most modern hard drives and SSDs. It keeps an eye on the health and reliability of your drives. In Unraid, %%SMART|smart%% monitoring acts as an early warning system, alerting you to possible drive failures before you lose any data.

## 为何 SMART 监控很重要

%%SMART|smart%%监控帮助您发现驱动器健康的微小变化，例如错误计数增加或坏扇区等，预防严重问题，如读写错误。注意这些警告，您可以替换或备份故障驱动器，保护您的宝贵数据。想要保持消息通畅，请启用[通知](../../getting-started/set-up-unraid/customize-unraid-settings.mdx#notification-settings)，即使未登录Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%%也能接收警报。

:::note
%%SMART|smart%% monitoring works for SATA drives but is not available for SAS drives.

## How Unraid uses SMART

Unraid constantly checks key %%SMART|smart%% attributes for each connected drive. If any of these attributes change, you'll see an orange icon next to the affected drive on the Dashboard. Clicking on the icon brings up a menu that lets you acknowledge the change. After that, Unraid will only notify you again if there are further updates to that attribute.

For a closer look at a drive's %%SMART|smart%% data, click its name on the **Main** tab in the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.

Some %%SMART|smart%% attributes Unraid monitors by default include:

| **ID**  | **Attribute**                                  | **What it means**                                                                                      | **When to be concerned / Action(s) to take**                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **5**   | Reallocated sectors count                      | This shows how many bad areas on the drive have been replaced with backup sectors.                     | If it's above 0, your drive is starting to fail. If this number grows, [back up your data](../../getting-started/set-up-unraid/complete-your-post-setup-essentials.mdx#back-up-your-flash-device) and get a new drive soon. |
| **187** | Reported uncorrected errors                    | These are errors that the drive couldn't fix.                                                          | If this shows any number greater than 0, it's a serious sign. Replace the drive as soon as you can.                                                                                                                         |
| **188** | Command timeout                                | This counts how often operations took too long, pointing to possible drive or cable issues.            | Occasional timeouts can happen due to power problems. If this is frequently above 0, check your cables and power connections.                                                                                               |
| **197** | Current/Pending sector count                   | This indicates unstable sectors that might fail soon.                                                  | Any number above 0 means the drive can't read some areas properly. If it doesn't go back to 0 after a few days, replace the drive.                                                                                          |
| **198** | Uncorrectable Sector count                     | These sectors can't be read or written even after multiple attempts.                                   | If you see that this number is greater than 0, it means you've lost data. Replace the drive right away.                                                                                                                     |
| **199** | %%UDMA\|udma%% %%CRC error\|crc-errors%% count | This shows errors in the data transfer between the drive and the computer, often caused by bad cables. | If this number goes up, check and reconnect the SATA cables. If it stops increasing after that, it should be fine.                                                                                                          |

## What to do if you get a SMART warning

If you receive a %%SMART|smart%% warning, here's what you should do:

- Check the affected attribute(s) in the table above.
- If you see that the counts for reallocated, pending, or uncorrectable sectors are rising, it's time to plan on replacing the drive soon.
- For %%CRC errors|crc-errors%%, inspect your data cables and make sure they're securely seated.
- If you're uncertain about a warning, don't hesitate to utilize the [Unraid forums](https://forums.unraid.net/) or consult your drive manufacturer's documentation.

:::warning
%%SMART|smart%% warnings are early signals that shouldn't be ignored. Take action to back up your data and consider replacing the drive before it fails.
