A %%parity check|parity-check%% is essential when your array includes at least one assigned parity device. During this process, all data disks are read simultaneously. The system recalculates the parity and compares it to the information stored on your %%parity disk(s)|parity-drives%%.

  A %%parity|parity%% sync reads all data disks and creates %%parity|parity%% from scratch, saving the results on the %%parity drives|parity-drives%%. This process typically happens when you add or replace a %%parity drives|parity-drives%% or after significant configuration changes.

  A %%parity check|parity-check%% reads all data disks along with the %%parity drives|parity-drives%%. It recalculates the %%parity|parity%% values and compares them to the stored values. There are two modes for running a %%parity check|parity-check%%:

  - **Correcting (CORRECT):** If it finds a mismatch, it updates the %%parity disk|parity-drives%% and logs the event.
  - **Non-correcting (NOCORRECT):** Only logs any errors found without updating the parity.

  To avoid excessive logging, only the first 100 addresses with errors are reported during a %%parity check|parity-check%%. These mismatches are referred to as **sync errors** and indicate where the parity does not align with the data, typically due to issues such as sudden power losses or hardware problems. Each sync error is counted in 4KiB blocks - this is the system's I/O unit size (known as the Linux page size).

  <summary><strong>In-depth: What does "valid" mean for parity and array disks?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  A **valid %%parity disk|parity-drives%%** indicates that after the last successful %%parity|parity%% sync, Unraid recognized the %%parity|parity%% as "good," meaning it's suitable for data recovery if a disk fails. The "valid" status applies to every disk in the array, not just the %%parity|parity%% one. If all disks except one are valid, Unraid can reconstruct the missing or failed disk's data using %%parity|parity%%.

  Unraid maintains the %%parity disk|parity-drives%%'s "valid" status even when some sync errors occur following a non-correcting check. This ensures that you can still recover a failed disk. If the %%parity|parity%% were marked as invalid, you would risk having two invalid disks after just one additional failure, leading to potential data loss.
</details>

While a %%parity check|parity-check%% is in progress, you can still use the array. However, be aware that performance may slow down due to drive contention, as both file operations and the check will compete for resources.

Normally, if the %%parity check|parity-check%% identifies errors, Unraid will update the %%parity disk|parity-drives%% to align with the computed data and increment the Sync Errors counter.

:::tip
If you prefer to run a check without making corrections, simply uncheck **Write corrections to parity** before starting. This way, errors will be reported but not fixed.

:::important
After an "Unsafe Shutdown"—when the array is restarted without being properly stopped—Unraid automatically initiates a %%parity check|parity-check%% using the mode configured under **Settings → Scheduler → Parity Check** (non-correcting by default). To change how the automatic check runs, open **Settings → Scheduler → Parity Check** and adjust the options there. Unexpected power loss is the most common trigger for an unsafe shutdown, so using an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is strongly recommended to protect your data.

<h4>What are parity errors?</h4>

%%Parity|parity%% errors happen when the %%parity|parity%% information your system calculates doesn't match what's stored on your %%parity drives|parity-drives%%. This mismatch can arise from several issues, including:

- Sudden power loss or unsafe shutdowns
- Failing drives or disk errors
- Problems with cables or connections
- Unclean shutdowns or unexpected system crashes

When %%parity|parity%% errors occur, either the %%parity drives|parity-drives%% or the data disks could be out of sync. Ideally, a %%parity check|parity-check%% should report zero errors so everything functions correctly.

<h4>What to do if you encounter %%parity|parity%% errors</h4>

If your %%parity check|parity-check%% reveals errors:

1. **Investigate the problem:** Start by checking %%SMART reports|smart-report%%, which provide detailed information about your drives' health. Look for any signs of disk or connection problems.
2. **Seek help from our forums:** If you cannot resolve the issue on your own, consider reaching out for advice on the Unraid forums. The community can offer valuable insights and suggestions based on their experiences.
3. **Run another check:** After you've addressed any hardware issues, running another %%parity check|parity-check%% is a good idea to ensure everything is back in order.

:::info[Rebuild Time]
Remember that %%parity checks|parity-check%% can take several hours, depending on the size of your disks and the activity level of your system. For the best results, schedule these checks during times of low system usage.
