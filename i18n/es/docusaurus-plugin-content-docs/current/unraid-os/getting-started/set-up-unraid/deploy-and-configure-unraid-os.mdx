# Desplegar & configurar Unraid OS

After booting Unraid OS for the first time, you'll use the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to complete your system configuration. This interface lets you manage your server, set up storage, configure user shares, and control features like %%hardware virtualization|hvm%% and Docker containers.

:::info\[Localize]

It may be easier for users to follow this guide after configuring their language settings.  Check out [Multi-language support](../../using-unraid-to/customize-your-experience/multi-language-support.mdx) to make the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% more accessible in your preferred language.

:::

## Connect to the Unraid WebGUI

You can connect to the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% in two ways:

- **GUI Mode:** Boot Unraid in GUI mode and sign in using a keyboard and monitor connected to the server. Use `root` as the username with no initial password.
- **Web Browser:** On another device on your local network, visit `http://tower.local`. If you set a different hostname, use that instead of `tower` (i.e., for the hostname `unraidserver`, you'd visit `http://unraidserver.local`). %%mDNS|mdns%% handles the resolution of these `.local` addresses.

:::important
The Unraid server is accessible on your LAN as soon as it’s fully booted. You can find the IP address on your router’s DHCP client list or by using a network scanning tool.

## Set a root password

When you access the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% for the first time, you'll be prompted to create a strong password for the %%root user|root-user%%.

Make sure your password is:

- Unique
- At least 8 characters long.  (Although, best practice recommends 12+ for the most secure passwords!)
- A mix of letters, numbers, and special characters

We recommend using a password manager for secure storage.

</div>

:::tip
If you forget your root password, you can reset it following the [Reset your password](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/user-management.mdx#reset-your-password) guide. You can also update your password in the Users page of the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.

## Register your license key

After setting your root password, log in to your Unraid.net account to obtain a license key:

1. In the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, go to the **Get Started** section.

   <div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '500px'}}>
     ![Get started](/img/Upc_get_started.png)
   </div>

2. Sign in or create an account, after which a trial key will be installed automatically.

   <div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '500px'}}>
     ![Install trial key](/img/Upc_install_trial_key.png)
   </div>

   This process allows you to manage your Unraid OS license keys, obtain new keys, recover lost ones, or upgrade your license.

## BIOS Recommendations

Before deploying Unraid OS, it's important to verify your system's BIOS and storage controller settings. Below, you can find a checklist to help ensure compatibility, stability, and access to key features.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand our BIOS and Storage Controller checklist</summary>

  Proper BIOS and storage controller configuration is vital for a stable Unraid OS deployment. Use this checklist before your first boot.

  ### Basic Settings

  ✅ Set the USB flash drive as the primary boot device.\
  ✅ Configure the storage controller to **%%AHCI|ahci%%** mode with SATA connections.\
  ✅ Set the controller to **%%HBA mode|hba-mode%%** (not **%%RAID|raid%%**).\
  ✅ Disable **Secure Boot** as it is not supported by Unraid OS.

  ### Advanced Settings

  ✅ Enable **%%hardware virtualization|hvm%%** features (e.g., **%%Intel VT-x|intel-vt-x%%** or **%%AMD-V|amd-v%%**) for **%%virtual machines (VMs)|vm%%**.\
  ✅ Enable **%%IOMMU|iommu%%** support (Intel VT-d or AMD-Vi) for PCI device assignment to VMs.

  ### Troubleshooting Tips

  If Unraid OS does not boot, try:

  ✅ Adjusting the boot order to: **Forced-FDD**, **USB-HDD**, **USB-ZIP**.\
  ✅ Disabling USB 2.0/3.0 support.\
  ✅ Toggling any Fast Boot features.\
  ✅ Toggling USB keyboard support.

  For further assistance, visit the [Unraid general support forum](https://forums.unraid.net/).

  :::important
  Many motherboards limit boot device selection to 12 hard drives. If your USB flash drive is recognized as a hard drive, you may not be able to boot from it after installing 12 physical hard drives. Configure the BIOS to treat the flash drive as a removable device whenever possible.

  If using an add-on HBA, you may be able to disable INT 13h support to prevent its connected drives from appearing in the bootable devices list, helping to stay within the 12-drive limit.
