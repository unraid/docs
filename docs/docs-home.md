## Unraid Documentation

Welcome! <Term popup="A standard interface mode for disk controllers that allows storage devices to communicate with your computer. In Unraid, AHCI mode is typically recommended for better compatibility." reference="\docs\terms\AHCI">AHCI</Term> 

Hi Larry.  This landing page is temporary while I'm working on the rest of the documentation, and will be completed after the content is in place.  Also, there's a glossary term at the beginning so you can see what that functionality will look like.  Have a great day!
