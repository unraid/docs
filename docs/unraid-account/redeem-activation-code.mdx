## How to Redeem Your Activation Code

First, follow our [Getting Started guide](/go/getting-started/) to set up an Unraid server.

When your server is up and running, instructions to activate your license are as follows:

### For Unraid 6.10 and later

1. Login to your Unraid server's webgui ([http://tower](http://tower) or [http://tower.local](http://tower.local) on Mac by default).

2. Sign in to your Unraid.net account (or create one) from the top-right of the webgui and select "Redeem Activation Code".

3. Enter the activation code from your email or purchase confirmation and complete the activation process.

### For Upgrade Activation Codes

1. Login to your Unraid server's webgui.

2. Choose "Upgrade Key" from the dropdown in the top-right of the webgui.

3. Scroll down to find the "Redeem an upgrade activation code" input.

4. Enter the activation code to activate your license.

### For Unraid 6.9 and older

1. Navigate to the **Tools â†’ Registration** page in the webgui.

2. Click "Purchase Key."

3. Enter the activation code listed on your order invoice and complete the activation process.

## Alternative: Redeem via Account Dashboard

You can also redeem your activation code through your Unraid account dashboard:

1. Navigate to your Unraid server's webgui and ensure you're signed in to your Unraid.net account from the top-right corner.

2. Click on the top-right corner of the webgui and select **"Redeem Activation Code"** or **"Upgrade License"** to open the account dashboard with your server context loaded.

3. In the account application, you'll see the "Redeem Activation Code" page. Here you have two options:
   - **Select from your codes**: If you have eligible activation codes for this server, you can choose one from the dropdown menu. Eligible codes are automatically filtered based on your server's compatibility.
   - **Enter code manually**: Click "Enter code instead" (or use manual entry if no eligible codes are available) and type your activation code exactly as it appears in your email or purchase confirmation.

4. Click **"Redeem Code"** to complete the activation process. Once successful, your license will be installed on the server.

:::note[Server Context Required]

If you don't see the redemption form, you may need to load your server context first. Click **"Manage Server"** to connect your server to the account application.

## Important Notes

- Activation codes are one-time use only to generate the license keyfile for your server.
- Make sure you're logged in with the same account that purchased the license.
- The activation code must match the server you're trying to activate.
