## How to Redeem Your Activation Code

When your server is up and running, instructions to activate your license are as follows:

### For Unraid 6.10 and later

1. Login to your Unraid server's webgui ([http://tower](http://tower) or [http://tower.local](http://tower.local) on Mac by default).

2. Sign in to your Unraid.net account (or create one) from the top-right of the webgui and select "Redeem Activation Code".

3. Enter the activation code from your email or purchase confirmation and complete the activation process.

### For Upgrade Activation Codes

1. Login to your Unraid server's webgui.

2. Choose "Upgrade Key" from the dropdown in the top-right of the webgui.

3. Scroll down to find the "Redeem an upgrade activation code" input.

4. Enter the activation code to activate your license.

### For Unraid 6.9 and older

1. Navigate to the **Tools â†’ Registration** page in the webgui.

2. Click "Purchase Key."

3. Enter the activation code listed on your order invoice and complete the activation process.

## Alternative: Redeem via Account Dashboard

You can also redeem your activation code through your Unraid account dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Unraid account](https://unraid.net/account).

2. Navigate to the activation code redemption page.

3. Enter your activation code and select the server you want to apply it to.

4. Complete the redemption process.

## Important Notes

- Activation codes are one-time use only to generate the license keyfile for your server.
- Make sure you're logged in with the same account that purchased the license.
- The activation code must match the server you're trying to activate.
