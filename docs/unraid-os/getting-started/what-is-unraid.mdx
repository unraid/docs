# What is Unraid?

Unraid is an embedded operating system designed to give you complete control over your hardware.  It functions as a robust network-attached storage (NAS) system, an %%application server|application-server%%, and a host for %%virtual machines (VMs)|vm%%.

Unraid installs on a USB flash drive and boots from it, loading into a root RAM file system.  It uses a modern Linux kernel with updated hardware drivers, allowing it to run on nearly any 64-bit x86\_64 system while maintaining a minimal memory footprint.  All configuration data for the operating system is stored on the flash drive and loads simultaneously with the operating system.

Unraid features a [user-friendly web interface](./explore-the-user-interface/tour-the-web-gui.mdx) for easy management.  It offers basic controls for common tasks and advanced settings for experienced users.  While it defaults to settings that suit most people, it also allows customization.  This blend of simplicity and flexibility helps you store, protect, share, and enjoy your content effectively.

**Unraid's core capabilities lie within three main areas:**

<details>
  <summary><h3>Software-defined NAS</h3>Allowing users to share storage capacity over a network efficiently.</summary>

  ### Arrays and Parity

  Unraid provides a simple and flexible solution for turning any 64-bit capable system into a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. It can handle a variety of drives, whether they connect through IDE, SATA, or SAS, and supports different drive sizes. This means you can add new drives one at a time as your storage needs grow, without having to reorganize your existing data when you expand your setup.

  The main job of an Unraid %%array|array%% is to organize and protect the data stored across several drives. It does this by using up to two special drives called %%parity drive|parity-drives%%s. These %%parity drive|parity-drives%%s are important because they help reconstruct your data if one of the other drives fails. In fact, with just one %%parity drive|parity-drives%%, you can protect all the other drives in your %%array|array%%, keeping your data safe. Plus, you can mix different sized drives and easily expand your storage over time, making Unraid a user-friendly option for anyone looking to manage their data effectively.

  <details>
    <summary><strong>How Parity Works</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

    In Unraid, %%parity|parity%% information is updated in real time.  To understand how this works, imagine the contents of a hard drive as a long stream of bits, where each bit is either a zero or a one.  By summing the nth bit values across all drives and determining whether that sum is even or odd, the corresponding nth %%parity|parity%% bit can be set accordingly.  If a data drive ever fails, this %%parity|parity%% information allows for an accurate determination of the exact bit values, facilitating a precise rebuild on the replacement drive.

    For example:

    <div style={{ maxWidth: '600px', margin: '1rem auto' }}>
      ![No Parity](/img/No_parity_500px.png)
    </div>

    In the image above, three drives contain streams of bits that vary by device size.  These drives are unprotected, so if one fails, data will be lost.  To protect against failure, we need a fourth disk as a %%parity disk|parity-drive%%, which must be equal to or larger than the largest data disk.

    To set the %%parity|parity%% bits, we find the total for each column.  If the sum is even, the %%parity|parity%% bit is 0; if odd, the %%parity|parity%% bit is 1.

    Here's the same image as before, but with %%parity|parity%% calculated per frame:

    <div style={{ maxWidth: '600px', margin: '1rem auto' }}>
      ![Parity](/img/Parity@500px.png)
    </div>

    Let’s assume that drive 2 in our example has failed, and a new drive has been purchased to replace it:

    <div style={{ maxWidth: '600px', margin: '1rem auto' }}>
      ![Drive Failure](/img/Drive_failure@500px.png)
    </div>

    To rebuild data on the new disk, we determine the missing bit rather than calculating the %%parity|parity%% bit.  For column 1, the sum is 0, so the missing bit is 0.  For column 6, with a sum of 1, the missing bit is 1.

    Rebuilding a disk using %%parity|parity%% protects against data loss and offers fault tolerance, ensuring full access to the system even if a drive fails.

  </details>

  ### User Shares

  Unraid is different from most %%RAID|raid%% systems because it saves data on individual drives instead of combining them into one. As a %%root user|root-user%%, you can create %%user shares|user-share%%, which are like top-level folders that gather files from multiple drives in the %%array|array%% or %%cache pool|cache-pool%%. This means you don’t have to worry about which specific drive holds your files; they are organized for you.

  You can also customize these shares to include or leave out certain drives and decide how files are spread across your storage. Additionally, you can manage how users access the shares by setting up network options, like %%SMB|samba%% and %%NFS|nfs%%, and applying security settings. To keep private data safe, you can create user accounts and set access limits for trusted individuals.

  ```mdx-code-block

    <div className="flex-container">
      <figure className="flex-figure">
        <img src="/img/User_shares_-_distribution@500px.png" alt="User shares distribution example" />

        <figcaption>User shares - Distribution</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <figcaption>User shares - Access</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

  ```

  ### Understanding Cache Drives

  One of the standout features of Unraid is the %%cache drive|cache%%, which helps speed up data transfer. When you use a %%cache drive|cache%% alongside three or more drives, you can write data up to **three times faster**. When you save files to a %%user shares|user-share%% with a %%cache drive|cache%%, the data is first stored on the %%cache drive|cache%%. This allows for quick writing, and later, a process called %%Mover|mover%% transfers the data to the main storage %%array|array%% - often during the night—making room on the %%cache drive|cache%%.

  For added data safety, you can set up a %%cache pool|cache-pool%% with multiple drives. This setup not only increases storage space but also uses technologies like %%ZFS|zfs%% or %%BTRFS|btrfs%% to provide extra protection for your data, similar to %%RAID 1|raid1%%. Overall, Unraid’s management of shares and %%cache drives|cache%% creates a flexible, efficient, and secure storage solution.

  <summary><h3>Application Server</h3>Enabling the execution of containerized applications.</summary>

  Unraid transforms your storage solution into a versatile %%application server|application-server%% through Docker containerization. This approach overcomes traditional NAS limitations while maintaining system stability and ease of use.

  Traditional NAS solutions present three key challenges for application hosting:

  1. **OS compatibility issues** - Being unable to run applications designed for different operating systems.
  2. **Complex lifecycle management** - Difficult installation experiiences can leave residual artifacts after removal.
  3. **Application conflicts** - Software components may interfere with each other or system operations.

  Unraid's use of Docker addresses these challenges in three key ways:

  1. **OS Independence** - Each container runs in its own Linux environment, eliminating compatibility issues with the host operating system.
  2. **Image-based Deployment** - Preconfigured application packages allow for one-click installation and complete uninstallation of applications.
  3. **Process Isolation** - Containerized applications operate in separate user spaces, preventing any conflicts between software.

  Docker containers allow you to run applications in isolated, lightweight environments without the overhead associated with %%virtual machines|vm%%. Unraid simplifies the use of Docker by providing access to thousands of pre-configured apps through [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and [Community Applications](../using-unraid-to/run-docker-containers/community-applications.mdx). This containerized approach enables Unraid users to run multiple applications simultaneously without compatibility issues. It also helps keep the system organized by using self-contained application packages and makes it easy to enhance server capabilities through Docker's ecosystem.

  <summary><h3>Virtualization Platform</h3>Running virtual machines with performance close to bare-metal hardware.</summary>

  Unraid functions as a virtualization host, using a %%hypervisor|hypervisor%% to securely allocate resources to virtualized guests. This allows you to run various applications in isolated environments, going beyond just network-attached storage.

  :::tip
  To use hardware virtualization in Unraid, ensure your CPU, chipset, BIOS, and device drivers are compatible. A full list of requirements is available in the [VM setup guide](../using-unraid-to/create-virtual-machines/overview-and-system-prep.mdx). If your server doesn't meet these requirements, the %%VMs|vm%% menu will be disabled in the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.

    <summary><strong>Benefits of Using Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

    While Docker containers are popular for Linux-based applications, %%VMs|vm%% enhance the flexibility and efficiency of your Unraid server setup and offer distinct advantages on your Unraid server:

    - **Isolation:** %%VMs|vm%% run independently in separate environments, ensuring that the failure of one does not affect the others.

    - **Consolidation:** Consolidate multiple physical servers into a single Unraid machine, reducing hardware needs and simplifying maintenance.

    - **Resource Allocation:** Unraid allows you to assign specific CPU, memory, storage, and network resources to each %%VM|vm%%, ensuring critical workloads receive necessary resources.

    - **Testing and Development:** %%VMs|vm%% enable easy creation and testing of software across different environments without requiring multiple physical machines.

    - **Security:** The isolation of %%VMs|vm%% enhances security, making it harder for malware to spread between them.

    - **Legacy Application Support:** %%VMs|vm%% let you run legacy applications or operating systems that may not be compatible with modern hardware.

    - **Resource Isolation:** Each %%VM|vm%% can have dedicated resources, preventing performance issues across %%VMs|vm%%.

    - **Resource Overcommitment:** You can run more %%VMs|vm%% than the physical resources would typically allow, understanding that not all will fully utilize their allocations at the same time.
