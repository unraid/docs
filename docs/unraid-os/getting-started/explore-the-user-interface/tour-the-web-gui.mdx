# Tour the WebGUI

The %%WebGUI|web-gui%% is the primary interface for managing and configuring your Unraid server. It provides access to all system features, monitoring tools, and configuration options through an organized navigation bar and user-friendly screens. This layout is designed to help you efficiently manage storage, users, applications, and system settings from any web browser.

## The Navigation Bar

The horizontal navigation bar gives users access to the main functional areas of the Unraid system. You can customize it with plugins to add extra menus and options, available in the [Community Applications section](../../using-unraid-to/run-docker-containers/community-applications.mdx).

  ![Navigation Bar - Annotated](/img/navbar3.png)

### 1. Dashboard

The **Dashboard** tab provides real-time monitoring of hardware and software components on your Unraid server. It displays various aspects of management - such as system identification, CPU, RAM, storage, network information, Containers, %%VMs|vm%%, users, and shares - in a grid of tiles.

You can enhance the Dashboard with plugins from [Community Applications](../../using-unraid-to/run-docker-containers/community-applications.mdx)

### 2. Main

The **Main** screen enables efficient management of your Unraid storage and disk operations. You can configure your %%array|array%%, %%cache pools|cache-pool%%, and flash devices, as well as manage USB storage and unassigned devices, including remote shares. It displays key information about each storage device, such as health, capacity, and file systems.

The **Shares** tab is divided into [User Shares](../../using-unraid-to/manage-storage/shares.mdx#user-shares) and [Disk Shares](../../using-unraid-to/manage-storage/shares.mdx#disk-shares).

You can access detailed information and management options for each share by selecting its name.

### 4. Users
