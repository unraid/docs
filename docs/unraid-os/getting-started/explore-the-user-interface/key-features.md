# Key Features

You can manage your Unraid system using an intuitive web interface, known as the **WebGUI**. This interface provides basic controls for common tasks while also offering advanced tuning options for experienced users. Unraid automatically selects default settings that are suitable for most users, but it also allows you to customize these settings to meet your specific needs.

This design makes Unraid easy to use where simplicity is most important, and adjustable where customization is critical. The simplified management features include:

- **Dashboard View** - The dashboard provides a detailed, real-time overview of your system, displaying indicators for disk health, temperatures, resource utilization, and application states.
- **Array Operation** - Manage your array effortlessly. You can assign devices for use in either the array or cache, spin individual disks up and down, start and stop the array, and even perform on-the-fly parity checks, all from a single page.
- **Share Management** - Setting up shares on Unraid is straightforward. Simply give the share a name, optionally apply access and distribution policies, and click "Create!"
- **Disk Tuning** - Control how and when devices spin down, select the default file system format, and adjust other advanced settings to reduce wear and power consumption on your devices.
- **Network Controls** - Enable <u>NIC bonding</u> and bridging, set time servers, and configure additional network settings.
- **APC UPS Safe Shutdown** - When connected to an APC UPS, Unraid can safely shut down the system in the event of a power loss.
- **System Notifications** - Unraid can alert you to important events through the web management console, as well as via email and other notification systems.
- **Task Scheduler** - Specify when to perform automatic parity checks and how often the mover script should transfer files from the cache to the array.
- **Docker Containers** - Manage application controls from a single interface. Add applications with minimal effort using community-provided templates.
- **Virtual Machines** - Choose from pre-created virtual machine images or create your own custom VM from scratch.
