# Tour the WebGUI

The WebGUI is the primary interface for managing and configuring your Unraid server. It provides access to all system features, monitoring tools, and configuration options through an organized navigation bar and user-friendly screens. This layout is designed to help you efficiently manage storage, users, applications, and system settings from any web browser.

## The Navigation Bar

The horizontal navigation bar gives users access to the main functional areas of the Unraid system. You can customize it with plugins to add extra menus and options, available in the <u>Community Applications section</u>.
