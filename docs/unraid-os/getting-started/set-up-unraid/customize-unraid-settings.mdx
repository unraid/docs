# Customize Unraid settings

Unraid OS automatically functions but allows further customization of settings such as IP address, hostname, disk tunables, and more via the **Settings** tab in the Unraid **%%WebGUI|web-gui%%**.

:::tip Tailscale integration

**Tailscale** is an optional plugin that you can install via the **Apps** tab by searching for "Tailscale". It provides secure remote access to your network and adds a **Tailscale** section to your **Settings** for enhanced remote management capabilities.

  ![Toolbar - Settings](/img/toolbar_settings.png)

</div>

Don't forget - the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% includes built-in help. To access help for a specific field, click the prompt next to it, or use the **Help** icon ![Help icon](/img/helpicon.png) at the top right of the interface to toggle help for all fields.

## System Settings

**System Settings** enable you to configure key functionalities like network, share, %%VM|vm%%, and disk settings.

### CPU Pinning

%%CPU Pinning|cpu-pinning%% allows you to assign specific CPU cores to %%VMs|vm%% (Virtual Machines) or Docker containers. This is particularly important for performance-sensitive workloads, such as gaming %%VMs|vm%%. Even if you manually assign Docker containers to avoid conflicts with your gaming %%VM|vm%%, the host operating system may still utilize those cores for tasks like managing the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, running a %%parity check|parity-check%%, or performing %%BTRFS|btrfs%% operations.

- When you pin a core to a %%VM|vm%% or Docker container, that core is allocated to the %%VM|vm%% or container. However, Unraid OS may still access it for routine tasks.
- When you isolate a core, it becomes dedicated to the %%VM|vm%% or container and is no longer accessible to Unraid OS.
- You can pin cores without needing to restart your server, but applying CPU isolation changes does require a system restart.

### Date & Time

On this page, you can set your time zone and toggle the use of up to four NTP servers. You should adjust Unraid to match your time zone for accurate timekeeping.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Toolbar - Settings](/img/date-time.png)

</div>

### Disk Settings

You can modify additional settings for your disk devices on this page. Enable your %%array|array%% to start automatically on boot, adjust disk %%spin-down timers|spin-down-timers%%, and even change advanced driver settings like %%SMART polling frequency|smart-polling%%.

<div className="flex-container" style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '800px'}}>

  </figure>

  <figure className="flex-figure">
    <img src="/img/disk-settings2.png" alt="Global SMART Settings" />
  </figure>
</div>

### Docker

Docker containers allow you to integrate pre-configured Linux applications into your Unraid server. For more details, see the [Docker Management](../../using-unraid-to/run-docker-containers/managing-and-customizing-containers.mdx) page.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Settings - Docker](/img/settings-docker.png)

</div>

### Identification

Unraid defaults to the hostname `tower`, but you can change it here. You can also add a description or model number for your system.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Settings - Identification](/img/settings-identification.png)

</div>

### Management Access

You can configure various access settings for your Unraid server, including enabling Telnet or %%SSH|ssh%%, setting ports for %%SSL|ssl%%/%%TLS|tls%%, HTTP, and HTTPS, and defining the default landing page for Unraid. For detailed information about securing your %%WebGUI|web-gui%% with %%SSL|ssl%% certificates, see [Securing your connection](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/securing-your-connection.mdx).

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Settings - Management Access](/img/settings-management-access.png)

</div>

### Network Settings

By default, Unraid tries to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server on your local network, usually provided by your router. On this page, you can configure a static IP address, set up %%bonding|nic-bonding%%, %%bridging|nic-bridging%%, or explore other options. While setting a static IP is recommended, it is not necessary to use Unraid.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Network Settings](/img/settings-network.png)

</div>

### Power Mode

The **Power Mode** setting allows you to optimize your Unraid server for energy efficiency, balanced operation, or maximum performance. You can choose from available modes - **Best power efficiency**, **Balanced operation**, or **Best performance** - to match your workload and energy preferences. Adjusting Power Mode can help reduce power consumption, lower system temperatures, or provide additional resources for demanding tasks.

Changes take effect immediately and do not require a system restart.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Power Mode](/img/settings-powermode.png)

</div>

### Global Share Settings

%%User shares|user-share%% can greatly simplify the organization and access of content across multiple disks in the %%array|array%%. You have the option to specify which disks are allowed to participate in %%user shares|user-share%% through global inclusion or exclusion settings.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Global Share Settings](/img/settings-globalshare.png)

</div>

### UPS Settings

Unraid can be connected to an APC (or compatible) UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to allow the system to safely shut down during a power loss while still receiving battery power. You can configure the UPS connection and set policies for the shutdown command on this page.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![UPS Settings](/img/settings-ups.png)

</div>

### VM Manager

**Virtual machines** (VMs) can turn your server into a desktop or media player, and run applications not designed for Linux. For details on managing %%VMs|vm%% on Unraid, see [VM setup](../../using-unraid-to/create-virtual-machines/vm-setup.mdx).

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![VM Manager](/img/settings-vmmanager.png)

## Network Services

**Network Services** let you configure network communication protocols on your Unraid server, which are essential for user and disk shares. You can also enable an %%FTP|ftp%% server, a logging server, and set up a %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% for secure remote access.

### NFS (Network File System)

NFSv4 support is available in Unraid. You can enable or disable it for %%user shares|user-share%% and adjust the `fuse_remember` tunable to help resolve *NFS Stale File Handle* errors.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![NFS](/img/settings-nfs.png)

</div>

### SMB (Server Message Block)

The SMB protocol is used by Microsoft Windows clients. From this page, you can enable it, define a workgroup, or join an Active Directory domain.
