# Customize Unraid settings

Unraid OS automatically functions but allows further customization of settings such as IP address, hostname, disk tunables, and more via the **Settings** tab in the Unraid **%%WebGUI|web-gui%%**.

:::tip[Tailscale integration]

**Tailscale** is an optional plugin that you can install via the **Apps** tab by searching for "Tailscale". It provides secure remote access to your network and adds a **Tailscale** section to your **Settings** for enhanced remote management capabilities.

:::

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '700px'}}>
  ![Toolbar - Settings](/img/toolbar_settings.png)
</div>

Don't forget - the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% includes built-in help. To access help for a specific field, click the prompt next to it, or use the **Help** icon ![Help icon](/img/helpicon.png) at the top right of the interface to toggle help for all fields.

## System settings

**System Settings** enable you to configure key functionalities like network, share, %%VM|vm%%, and disk settings.

### CPU pinning

%%CPU Pinning|cpu-pinning%% allows you to assign specific CPU cores to %%VMs|vm%% (Virtual Machines) or Docker containers. This is particularly important for performance-sensitive workloads, such as gaming %%VMs|vm%%. Even if you manually assign Docker containers to avoid conflicts with your gaming %%VM|vm%%, the host operating system may still utilize those cores for tasks like managing the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, running a %%parity check|parity-check%%, or performing %%BTRFS|btrfs%% operations.

- When you pin a core to a %%VM|vm%% or Docker container, that core is allocated to the %%VM|vm%% or container. However, Unraid OS may still access it for routine tasks.
- When you isolate a core, it becomes dedicated to the %%VM|vm%% or container and is no longer accessible to Unraid OS.
- You can pin cores without needing to restart your server, but applying CPU isolation changes does require a system restart.

### Date & time

On this page, you can set your time zone and toggle the use of up to four NTP servers. You should adjust Unraid to match your time zone for accurate timekeeping.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Toolbar - Settings](/img/date-time.png)
</div>

### Disk settings

You can modify additional settings for your disk devices on this page. Enable your %%array|array%% to start automatically on boot, adjust disk %%spin-down timers|spin-down-timers%%, and even change advanced driver settings like %%SMART polling frequency|smart-polling%%.

<div className="flex-container" style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '800px'}}>

  </figure>

  <figure className="flex-figure">
    <img src="/img/disk-settings2.png" alt="Global SMART Settings" />
  </figure>
</div>

### Docker

Docker containers allow you to integrate pre-configured Linux applications into your Unraid server. For more details, see the [Docker Management](../../using-unraid-to/run-docker-containers/managing-and-customizing-containers.mdx) page.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Settings - Docker](/img/settings-docker.png)
</div>

### Identification

Unraid defaults to the hostname `tower`, but you can change it here. You can also add a description or model number for your system.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Settings - Identification](/img/settings-identification.png)
</div>

### Management access

You can configure various access settings for your Unraid server, including enabling Telnet or %%SSH|ssh%%, setting ports for %%SSL|ssl%%/%%TLS|tls%%, HTTP, and HTTPS, and defining the default landing page for Unraid. For detailed information about securing your %%WebGUI|web-gui%% with %%SSL|ssl%% certificates, see [Securing your connection](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/securing-your-connection.mdx).

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Settings - Management Access](/img/settings-management-access.png)
</div>

### Network settings

By default, Unraid tries to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server on your local network, usually provided by your router. On this page, you can configure a static IP address, set up %%bonding|nic-bonding%%, %%bridging|nic-bridging%%, or explore other options. While setting a static IP is recommended, it is not necessary to use Unraid.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Network Settings](/img/settings-network.png)
</div>

#### WiFi setup

Unraid supports WiFi connectivity for situations where a wired network connection isn't practical or available. While a wired connection is generally recommended for better stability and performance, a wireless setup can be a suitable alternative when running a cable isn't an option.

:::important[Initial setup requirements]

For the initial WiFi setup, you'll need either:

- A local keyboard and monitor connected to your server (boot into GUI mode), or
- A temporary wired connection to access the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%

Once WiFi is configured, you can remove the wired connection and manage your server wirelessly.

:::

##### Setting up WiFi

1. Access the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% and go to ***Settings → Network Settings → Wireless wlan0***.
2. Enable WiFi by toggling the **Enable WiFi** option.
3. Configure the **Regulatory Region**:
   - In most cases, it’s best to leave this set to **Automatic**.
   - If your preferred network isn't appearing in the scan results, set it to your specific location (country/region).
4. Scan for available networks:
   - Available WiFi networks should be listed.
   - Click the **Connect to WiFi network** (ᯤ) icon next to your preferred network.
5. Enter your network credentials:
   - Type your WiFi password.
   - Review and adjust any additional settings if needed.
   - Click **Join this network** to connect.

:::tip[Docker containers and WiFi]

If you plan to use Docker containers with WiFi, ensure to unplug any wired connections **before** starting the Docker service. This helps prevent network configuration conflicts that can occur when both interfaces are active simultaneously.

:::

##### Supported WiFi features

Unraid's WiFi implementation supports the following:

- **WPA2** and **WPA3 security protocols**, including WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise networks. If both WPA2 and WPA3 are available, Unraid will automatically use WPA3 for enhanced security.
- **Modern WiFi adapters** that have Linux in-kernel driver support. Older adapters may not be compatible.

:::info[USB WiFi adapters]

If you're using a USB WiFi adapter, check this list of [USB WiFi adapters supported with Linux in-kernel drivers](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi/blob/main/home/USB_WiFi_Adapters_that_are_supported_with_Linux_in-kernel_drivers.md) to ensure compatibility.

If your WiFi adapter isn't detected, please start a new thread on the [Unraid forums](https://forums.unraid.net/) and provide your diagnostics for investigation.

:::

##### WiFi limitations

WiFi has some limitations compared to wired networking:

- You can only connect to **one WiFi network** at a time.
- Only one wireless NIC is supported - `wlan0`. If your system has multiple wireless adapters (`wlan1`, `wlan2`, etc.), only `wlan0` will be used.
- Unlike wired connections, you **cannot combine multiple wireless connections** to improve reliability.
- **`wlan0` cannot participate in a bond**. You cannot combine WiFi and Ethernet connections in a bond configuration.
- It's best to use either a wired connection or WiFi, but **not both at the same time**. If you need to temporarily connect or disconnect a network cable while using WiFi, your server should automatically adjust to use the active connection within about a minute. For important information about Docker containers when switching between connection types, see the **Docker and virtual machine considerations** section below.

##### Docker and virtual machine considerations

When using WiFi, there are specific considerations for Docker containers and %%virtual machines|vm%%:

###### Docker containers

- On ***Settings → Docker***, when WiFi is enabled, the system automatically uses **ipvlan** for custom networks (macvlan is not supported with WiFi).
- Host access to custom networks must be disabled in ***Settings → Docker***.
- Container **Network Type** cannot use `br0`, `bond0`, or `eth0`.

:::caution

Docker cannot participate in two networks sharing the same subnet. If you switch between wired and wireless connections, you will need to restart Docker and reconfigure all existing containers to use the new interface. This network configuration change requires container reconfiguration. It's strongly recommended to choose either wired or wireless and not switch between them.
:::

###### Virtual machines

It's recommended to set your %%VM|vm%% **Network Source** to **virbr0** (Private NAT). This mode works with any number of %%VMs|vm%% and provides network access through %%NAT|nat%%. Note that mDNS does not work through NAT, so the %%VM|vm%% will need to access other local network devices by IP address, not hostname. You can add IP addresses and hostnames to the hosts file on the %%VM|vm%% operating system to allow access by hostname. The %%VMs|vm%% won't be directly accessible from other devices on your LAN, but you can still access them via %%VNC|vnc-session%% through the host.

For more information about %%VM|vm%% networking, see [Overview and system prep](../../using-unraid-to/create-virtual-machines/overview-and-system-prep.mdx).

### Power mode

The **Power Mode** setting allows you to optimize your Unraid server for energy efficiency, balanced operation, or maximum performance. You can choose from available modes - **Best power efficiency**, **Balanced operation**, or **Best performance** - to match your workload and energy preferences. Adjusting Power Mode can help reduce power consumption, lower system temperatures, or provide additional resources for demanding tasks.

Changes take effect immediately and do not require a system restart.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Power Mode](/img/settings-powermode.png)
</div>

### Global share settings

%%User shares|user-share%% can greatly simplify the organization and access of content across multiple disks in the %%array|array%%. You have the option to specify which disks are allowed to participate in %%user shares|user-share%% through global inclusion or exclusion settings.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Global Share Settings](/img/settings-globalshare.png)
</div>

### UPS settings

Unraid can be connected to an APC (or compatible) UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to allow the system to safely shut down during a power loss while still receiving battery power. You can configure the UPS connection and set policies for the shutdown command on this page.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![UPS Settings](/img/settings-ups.png)
</div>

### VM manager

**Virtual machines** can turn your server into a desktop or media player, and run applications not designed for Linux. For details on managing %%VMs|vm%% on Unraid, see [VM setup](../../using-unraid-to/create-virtual-machines/vm-setup.mdx).

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![VM Manager](/img/settings-vmmanager.png)
</div>

## Network services

**Network Services** let you configure network communication protocols on your Unraid server, which are essential for user and disk shares. You can also enable an %%FTP|ftp%% server, a logging server, and set up a %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% for secure remote access.

### NFS (Network file system)

NFSv4 support is available in Unraid. You can enable or disable it for %%user shares|user-share%% and adjust the `fuse_remember` tunable to help resolve *NFS Stale File Handle* errors.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![NFS](/img/settings-nfs.png)
</div>

### SMB (Server message block)

The SMB protocol is used by Microsoft Windows clients. From this page, you can enable it, define a workgroup, or join an Active Directory domain.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![SMB](/img/settings-smb.png)
</div>

### FTP (File transfer protocol)

Users can connect via %%FTP|ftp%% only if they are added to the **FTP users** field on this page. If no users are added, the %%FTP|ftp%% service will not start.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![FTP](/img/settings-ftp.png)
</div>

### Syslog server

The %%Syslog server|syslog-server%% permanently stores your system log, which is useful for troubleshooting since Unraid clears the log after each reboot.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Syslog Server](/img/settings-syslog.png)
</div>

### Tailscale

:::note

The Tailscale section is only available if you have installed the Tailscale plugin.

:::

The %%Tailscale|tailscale%% section allows for secure remote access via the %%Tailscale|tailscale%% %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%%. Here, you can log in to connect your Unraid server to your %%Tailnet|tailnet%%, view the assigned IP address and hostname, and enable or disable %%Tailscale|tailscale%% connectivity.

You can also configure your server as a %%Subnet Router|subnet-routing%% for local devices or as an Exit Node to route internet traffic. This section enables management of advertised routes, exit node status, Docker container integration options, and connection status monitoring for troubleshooting.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![Tailscale Settings](/img/settings-tailscale.png)
</div>

### VPN manager

You can establish a %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% connection to your Unraid server using [%%Wireguard|wireguard%%](https://www.wireguard.com/) for secure internet connections.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px'}}>
  ![VPN Manager](/img/settings-vpnmanager.png)

For each notification type, you're able to set the frequency to *Never check*, or checking daily, weekly, monthly, or, in some cases, even multiple times a day.

#### Delivery methods

Choose how you want to receive notifications for each category (*Notices*, *Warnings*, and *Alerts*):

- **Browser**: Display notifications in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% when you're logged in
- **Email**: Send notifications via email (requires [SMTP configuration](#smtp-settings))
- **Agents**: Send notifications through configured third-party services

:::tip

Enable **Browser** notifications for immediate visibility when using the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, and **Email** for alerts when you're away from your server. Use **Agents** to integrate with mobile apps and services like Discord or Telegram.

:::

#### SMTP settings

To receive email notifications, you need to configure your email server settings. Unraid supports many email providers including Gmail, Outlook, and custom SMTP servers.

The SMTP settings can be found at ***Settings → User Preferences → Notification Settings → SMTP Settings***.

**Basic configuration:**

- **Preset service**: Select a preset configuration (*Gmail*, *Outlook/Hotmail*, or *Custom*) to auto-fill common settings
- **Sending email address**: The email address notifications will be sent from
- **Email recipients**: Comma-separated list of email addresses to receive notifications
- **Priority in header**: Mark emails as high priority (*Yes* or *No*)
- **Email subject prefix**: Text to prepend to all notification email subjects (default: *Unraid Status:*)

**Server settings:**

- **Mail server**: SMTP server address (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
- **Mail server port**: SMTP port number (common ports: `465` for SSL/TLS, `587` for STARTTLS, `25` for unencrypted)
- **Use SSL/TLS**: Enable SSL/TLS encryption (*Yes* or *No*)
- **Use STARTTLS**: Use STARTTLS for encryption (*Yes* or *No*)
- **Define a TLS certificate**: Specify a custom TLS certificate if needed (*Yes* or *No*)
- **TLS certificate location**: Path to custom certificate file (only if *Define a TLS certificate* is enabled)

**Authentication:**

- **Authentication method**: Choose *None*, *CRAM-MD5*, or *Login* (username/password)
- **Username**: Your email account username (usually your full email address)
- **Password**: Your email account password or app-specific password

After configuring your settings, use the **TEST** button to verify your email configuration is working correctly.

##### Configuring Gmail with app passwords

Gmail requires app-specific passwords when using SMTP with accounts that have 2-step verification enabled (which is recommended for security).

**To set up Gmail notifications:**

1. In **Preset service**, select *Gmail* (this will auto-fill the **Mail server** and **Mail server port**)
2. Enter your Gmail address in **Sending email address**
3. Enter recipient email address(es) in **Email recipients**
4. Set **Username** to your full Gmail address (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com`)
5. For **Password**, you'll need to generate an app password:
   - Go to your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Navigate to **Security**
   - Under "How you sign in to Google," ensure **2-Step Verification** is enabled (required for app passwords)
   - In the same section, find and click **App passwords** (or search for "App passwords" in the search bar)
   - You may need to verify your identity
   - Enter a custom name for the App name, like "Unraid Server".
   - Click **Create**
   - Google will generate a 16-character password.
   - Copy this password and paste it into the **Password** field in Unraid
6. Click **TEST** to verify the configuration
7. Click **DONE** to save your settings

:::tip[Default Gmail settings]

- **Mail server**: `smtp.gmail.com`
- **Mail server port**: `465`
- **Use SSL/TLS**: `Yes`
- **Use STARTTLS**: `No`
- **Authentication method**: `Login`

:::

:::warning[Security recommendation]

Always use app passwords instead of your main Gmail password. App passwords can be revoked individually without changing your main account password, providing better security if your Unraid configuration is ever compromised.

:::

#### Notification agents

Notification agents allow you to send alerts to third-party services and mobile apps. Unraid includes built-in support for many popular notification services.

To access Notification Agents, click the **Notification Agents** link on the Notification Settings page, or navigate to ***Settings → User Preferences → Notification Settings → Notification Agents***.
