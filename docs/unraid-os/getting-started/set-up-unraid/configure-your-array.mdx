# Configure your array

After installing your registration key, the next step is configuring your storage by assigning devices to the %%array|array%% and **pool devices**. This setup determines how Unraid OS manages your data, protects it with %%parity|parity%%, and optimizes performance with %%cache pools|cache-pool%%.

:::important
If you're struggling with any part of the Unraid installation, be sure to check out our [Installation FAQ](../../troubleshooting/faq.mdx#installation)!

## Assign Parity and Data disks

You’ll use the **Main** tab in the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to assign and review devices, including %%array|array%% and pool assignments along with any unassigned devices and your boot device (the **USB flash device**).

### Device Roles

Unraid OS uses drives for various purposes:

- **Array Devices**, which fall into two categories:
  - **Parity Devices:** Provide fault tolerance, allowing recovery of data if a data drive fails. You can assign up to two parity drives.
  - **Data Devices:** Store your custom shares and folders, as well as any files you add to them, i.e., media files.

- **Pool Devices:** High-performance drives used primarily as a **cache**, storing files temporarily to enhance performance before transferring them to the %%array|array%%.

- **Boot Device:** The USB flash device containing Unraid OS, which starts your server.

  <summary>Disk assignment recommendations</summary>

  These disk assignment recommendations are crafted to optimize your Unraid %%array|array%%, enhancing performance, data protection, and future expandability. By following these, you can effectively maximize your storage devices and avoid common setup issues.

  1. **Select the largest %%parity device|parity-drives%%:**
     Always choose the largest available storage device as your %%parity device|parity-drives%%(s). When expanding your %%array|array%%, data disks must be equal to or smaller than your %%parity device|parity-drives%%(s). You should purchase the largest **HDD** for your initial %%parity device|parity-drives%% to avoid future limitations. For dual %%parity disks|parity-drives%%, each parity disk must be greater than or equal to the largest data disk.

  2. **Utilize HDDs for the %%array|array%% and SSD/NVMe drives for pools:**
     For optimal performance, use **HDDs** as the primary storage devices in the %%array|array%% for general storage and %%parity|parity%% protection. Assign **SSD** or **NVMe** drives to a %%cache pool|cache-pool%% or dedicated pool to enhance high-speed read and write operations. This setup improves overall performance by taking advantage of the strengths of each type of drive.

  3. **Protect cached data with a %%multi-device pool|multi-device-pool%%:**
     To safeguard cached data, assign more than one device to the %%cache pool|cache-pool%%. A single device does not offer protection from data loss. %%Cache pools|cache-pool%% can be expanded on demand.

  :::warning
  SSD support is experimental in the %%array|array%%. Some SSDs may not perform well due to variations in %%TRIM/Discard|trim-discard%% implementation, which could lead to undesirable results. This does not apply to %%cache pools|cache-pool%%. [Learn more about filesystem options here](../../using-unraid-to/manage-storage/file-systems.mdx).
  :::

  :::note
  SSD-based pools are optimal for applications and virtual machines, leveraging SSD performance for faster interactions. [Learn more about running applications here](../../using-unraid-to/run-docker-containers/overview.mdx).

:::important
Your %%array|array%% will not start if you exceed the number of storage devices permitted by your license key.

## Start and format the array

After assigning all your devices, click the **Start** button under **Array Operation** to mount them and start the %%array|array%%.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '500px'}}>
  ![Array Operation Start](/img/arrayoperation_start.png)
</div>

New devices will appear as *Unformatted* and cannot be used until formatted. Unraid defaults to the %%XFS|xfs%% filesystem for array devices. For %%cache pools|cache-pool%%, %%BTRFS|btrfs%% is always used by default when using auto mode, but you can choose your desired filesystem when adding devices to a pool. You can change the default filesystem for the array in ***Settings → System Settings → Disk Settings***.

To format your devices, check the **Format** box under **Array Operation**, read the prompt carefully, and click the **Format** button.

A parity sync will run in the background to protect the %%array|array%% even before formatting is complete. The %%array|array%% will function in an unprotected state until the sync finishes, so it's best to wait before adding data.

### Changing filesystems on existing drives

To change the filesystem of an existing drive:

1. **Back up your data**: Reformatting will erase all data on the drive.
2. **Stop the array**.
3. **Click on the drive** and change the filesystem type (e.g., %%XFS|xfs%%, %%BTRFS|btrfs%%).
4. **Start the array** and check the **Format** box under **Array Operation**.
5. **Click Format** to apply the new filesystem.

:::caution
Reformatting a drive will erase all its data. For %%RAID|raid%% setups, check the %%parity|parity%% to avoid data loss during rebuilds. Use the [Unassigned Devices plugin](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=unassigned+devices#r:~:text=don%27t%20be%20carefull!!!-,Unassigned%20Devices,-dlandon) to back up your files before reformatting.

:::info
You may stop the array, shut down, or reboot using the respective buttons in the same **Array Operation** section in the **Main** tab.
