# Complete your post-setup essentials

Congratulations on your initial setup!  

Now, it's time to explore a few more important aspects that will enhance your server's functionality and security.

## Back up your flash device

Always back up your Unraid flash device after making significant configuration changes. Regular backups are *highly* recommended.

To back up your flash device, go to the **Main** tab, select the device, and click on **Flash Backup**.

:::warning
Store backups outside the Unraid array for easy access if the array isn't operational.
:::
:::note
Alternatively, use the [Unraid Connect](https://docs.unraid.net/connect/) plugin for automated backups to LimeTech's cloud servers.

## Use the built-in help

Unraid provides extensive help text for settings in the WebGUI. Enable it by clicking the ![Help icon](/img/helpicon.png) icon at the top-right corner. You can also toggle help on individual fields by clicking their names. The WebGUI help will typically offer the most up-to-date information help information.

## Review security best practices
