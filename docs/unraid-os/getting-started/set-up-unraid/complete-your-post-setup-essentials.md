# Complete your post-setup essentials

Congratulations on your initial setup!  

Now, it's time to explore a few more important aspects that will enhance your server's functionality and security.

## Back up your flash device

Always back up your Unraid flash device after making significant configuration changes. Regular backups are *highly* recommended.

To back up your flash device, go to the **Main** tab, select the device, and click on **Flash Backup**.

:::warning
Store backups outside the Unraid %%array|array%% for easy access if the %%array|array%% isn't operational. [Learn more about flash device management here](../../system-administration/maintain-and-update/changing-the-flash-device.md).
:::

:::note
Alternatively, use the [Unraid Connect](../../../unraid-connect/overview-and-setup.md) plugin for automated backups to LimeTech's cloud servers.

## Use the built-in help

Unraid provides extensive help text for settings in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. Enable it by clicking the ![Help icon](/img/helpicon.png) icon at the top-right corner. You can also toggle help on individual fields by clicking their names. The %%WebGUI|web-gui%% help will typically offer the most up-to-date information help information.

## Review security best practices

Since your Unraid server contains valuable data, it's wise to review the [security best practices](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/security-fundamentals.md) in the documentation to avoid potential attacks and protect your information.

## Unraid Connect

[Unraid Connect](../../../unraid-connect/overview-and-setup.md) is a plugin for Unraid that can be found in the Community Applications section. With Unraid Connect, you can manage all your server instances through a [unified dashboard](https://connect.myunraid.net/).

![Unraid Connect Dashboard](/img/unraidconnectdashboard.png)

Unraid Connect uses your Unraid.net credentials for access management and communicates with our cloud servers over a secure connection. 

For more information on how we handle your data, please refer to the [Privacy section](../../../unraid-connect/overview-and-setup.md#data-collection-and-privacy) in our Unraid Connect documentation.
