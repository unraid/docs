# Simplified Management

You manage your Unraid system through an intuitive web interface - or WebGUI - that offers basic controls for common tasks, as well as advanced tuning options for the savvy user. Unraid automatically chooses default settings that should work for most people's needs, but also allows you to tweak settings to your needs.

This makes Unraid intuitive where you want it, and tunable where you need it. The simplified management features include:

* **Dashboard View** - With indicators for disk health, temperatures, resource utilization, and application states, the dashboard provides a detailed, realtime overview of what's happening on your system.
* **Array Operation** - Assign devices for use in either the array or cache, spin individual disks up and down, start and stop the array, and even perform on-the-fly parity checks, all from a single page.
* **Share Management** - Setting up shares on Unraid is easy. Give the share a name, optionally apply policies to access and distribution controls, them click create!
* **Disk Tuning** - Control how and when devices spin down, the default file system format, and other advanced settings that reduce wear and power consumption on your devices.
* **Network Controls** - Enable NIC bonding and bridging, set time servers, and more.
* **APC UPS Safe Shutdown** - When connected to an APC UPS, Unraid can safely shut down the system in the event of a power loss.
* **System Notifications** - Unraid can alert you to important events happening on your system through the web management console as well as e-mail and other notification systems.
* **Task Scheduler** - Choose if and when you want to have an automatic parity check occur as well as how often the mover script should transfer files from the cache to the array.
* **Docker Containers** - Manage application controls from a single interface. Add applications with minimal effort using community-provided templates.
* **Virtual Machines** - Choose between pre-created virtual machine images or create your own custom VM from scratch.
