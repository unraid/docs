Starting with Unraid 7.0, XFS file system repair is now fully automated through the WebGUI:

1. Click the **CHECK** button (no options to enter).
2. Check results:
   - **No corruption detected**: Shows "no filesystem corruption detected" and the **CHECK** button remains.
   - **Corruption detected**: Shows "filesystem corruption detected" and a **FIX** button appears.
3. Click **FIX** to automatically repair the file system.
4. If needed, a **ZERO LOG** button may appear.
5. The process shows "filesystem repaired" when complete.

This automated system eliminates the need for users to manually enter repair options and ensures the correct repair sequence is followed.

:::note

- Repairs maintain %%parity|parity%% protection and can take significant time.
- Both %%WebGUI|web-gui%% and command-line options are supported for %%XFS|xfs%% repair (commands shown below).
