- Use `btrfs scrub` in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to scan for and repair certain errors.
- On single drives, scrub may detect but not fix some errors; if so, consider copying data and reformatting the disk or pool.

:::note
- Current %%BTRFS|btrfs%% repair tools may not address all corruption; check Unraid documentation for updated tools if needed.
- For more details on scrub and recovery, refer to the respective %%BTRFS|btrfs%% documentation or Unraid forums for guidance.
