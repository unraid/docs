# System crashes & stability

System crashes and stability issues can be tough to diagnose and resolve. They often come from hardware failures, configuration mistakes, or conflicts within software. This section will guide you through common causes, diagnostic steps, and best practices to help keep your Unraid server stable.

---

## RAM issues

Memory problems are among the most common causes of system instability and data corruption. RAM can wear out over time, leading to unpredictable errors that are often difficult to diagnose. This section covers how to identify and resolve memory-related stability issues.

Common symptoms of RAM problems include:

- Unexplained system crashes or freezes
- Data corruption in files or %%array|array%%
- Random application errors
- System instability under load
- Failed %%parity checks|parity-check%%

### Testing RAM

Memory testing is essential for diagnosing stability issues. The Unraid boot menu includes Memtest86+ for comprehensive RAM testing, which works on both Legacy and %%UEFI|uefi%% systems.

To test your RAM:

1. Restart your server and select **Memtest86+** from the boot menu.
2. Let the test run for at least 2-4 hours for thorough coverage.
3. Monitor for any error messages or failed tests.

### Overclocking RAM

RAM overclocking can significantly impact system stability. Many users want to run their RAM at the highest speed specified by the manufacturer, but motherboard and CPU combinations often have maximum reliable RAM speeds that are lower than what the RAM is rated for.

:::caution[RAM overclocking risks and recommendations]

**Purchasing:** When possible, always purchase RAM that is listed on your motherboard's QVL (Qualified Vendor List), not from the RAM manufacturer's QVL. This ensures better compatibility and stability.

**Intel XMP and AMD AMP profiles are overclocks.** For the best stability, always run RAM at SPD speeds, not XMP/AMP speeds.

**Risks of overclocking:**

- System instability and random crashes
- Data corruption and file system errors
- Reduced hardware lifespan
- Incompatibility with other components

**Troubleshooting:** If Memtest86+ passes but you're still experiencing issues, disable XMP/AMP and try again. The performance difference is usually minimal, but the stability improvement can be significant.

:::

<h4>Best practices</h4>

1. Always check your motherboard and CPU specifications before attempting to overclock.
2. **For maximum stability:** Disable XMP/AMP profiles and run RAM at default SPD speeds.
3. Start with conservative settings and gradually increase.
4. Test stability with Memtest86+ after any changes.
5. If you notice instability, immediately revert to default or lower speeds.
6. Consider the trade-off between performance and stability for server environments.

## Critical stability factors

System stability relies on more than just RAM or CPU performance. Multiple hardware and software components work together to maintain reliable operation. This section covers the key areas that influence your Unraid server's stability and provides actionable steps to prevent and resolve issues.

System stability typically depends on:

### Power supply reliability

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  A stable and sufficient power supply is crucial for uninterrupted server operation. Power issues are often overlooked but can cause the most frustrating stability problems.

  Common power-related issues include:

  - Random system crashes or freezes
  - Data corruption during writes
  - Sudden shutdowns without warning
  - Hardware component failures
  - Inconsistent performance

  <h4>Prevention and maintenance</h4>

  Proactive power supply maintenance prevents the most common stability issues. Regular checks and proper component selection can avoid costly downtime and data loss.

  1. Always use a high-quality, appropriately rated PSU for your hardware.
  2. **Critical:** Ensure your power supply can handle simultaneous spin-up of ALL attached storage devices. The 12V rail current rating must account for the spin-up current of all drives at once, not staggered.
  3. Avoid power splitters whenever possible. They can cause voltage drops and instability, especially during high-current events like drive spin-up.
  4. Consider redundant power supplies for enterprise and multi-bay systems.
  5. Ensure each PSU unit is properly seated and connected.
  6. Monitor PSU health indicators (like AC OK LEDs) if available.
  7. Replace failed units immediately to avoid downtime.
  8. Regularly check that all power cords are secure.
  9. Verify circuits are not overloaded.
