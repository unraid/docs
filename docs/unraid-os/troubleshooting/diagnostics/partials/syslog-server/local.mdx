To create a persistent, reliable copy of your Unraid %%syslog|syslog%% on your server:

1. Set **Local syslog server** to *Enabled*.
2. Configure the following options:
   - **Local %%syslog|syslog%% folder**: Use a cache-only or preferred share (best for SSDs).
   - **Rotation settings**: Adjust the file size and number limits.
3. For best results and to ensure all %%syslog|syslog%% data (including boot events) is captured, set the **Remote %%syslog server|syslog-server%%** field to your server's own IP address (the "Loopback method"), or the %%syslog|syslog%% will not be saved to the set share.
   - This ensures %%syslog|syslog%% events are both stored locally and persist across reboots, without writing to the flash drive.
4. Click **Apply**.
   - Logs will be saved to the share you specified.

:::note
- If you upload files from the local %%syslog server|syslog-server%% to the forum, they will **not** be anonymized.
- Logs saved using this method are not included in standard diagnostics. Attach them separately if you need support.
