1. Select **Yes** under **Mirror to flash**.
2. Click **Apply**. Logs will be saved to `/boot/logs/syslog` on your flash drive

On the next reboot, this file will be renamed to `/boot/logs/syslog-previous`. You can view this file through **Tools → Syslog → syslog-previous**, and it will also be included (anonymized) in diagnostics.

<h4>How it works</h4>

- By default, Unraid copies the %%syslog|syslog%% to the flash drive during every graceful shutdown. This is managed through the "copy %%syslog|syslog%% to flash on shutdown" setting, which is enabled by default.
- If you're troubleshooting crashes, you can enable "Mirror to flash." This will write the %%syslog|syslog%% to both `/var/log/syslog` and `/boot/logs/syslog` in real time. If a crash happens, any %%syslog|syslog%% entries recorded to flash before the crash will be preserved.

Both methods result in the creation of a `/boot/logs/syslog-previous` file after the next boot, which you can access via the %%syslog|syslog%% viewer and will be included in diagnostics.

:::caution

The **Copy %%syslog|syslog%% to flash on shutdown** setting is safe for your flash drive. However, enabling **Mirror to flash** can lead to excessive writes if left on for an extended period. For long-term logging needs, consider using a local or remote %%syslog server|syslog-server%% instead.
