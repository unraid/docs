For additional support, the Unraid community forums are a fantastic resource. When seeking help, remember to:

- **Capture diagnostics before rebooting.**
  Go to ***Tools → Diagnostics*** to generate a diagnostics file that preserves logs and system details necessary for troubleshooting.
- **Share the diagnostics file** in a [post on the Unraid forums](http://forums.unraid.net/) to assist others in helping you effectively.
