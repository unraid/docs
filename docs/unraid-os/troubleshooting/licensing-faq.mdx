## License Types & Features

### Is Unraid OS a subscription? {#subscription}

No. Unraid OS is a **perpetual license**:

- **Starter** and **Unleashed** include one year of updates, after which you may pay a $36 USD annual extension fee (optional).
- **Lifetime** includes updates for the life of the product.
- If you choose not to pay the extension fee, you retain your existing version indefinitely; you simply won't receive new major updates.

You continue to own your license even if you stop paying for updates.

### What happens if I don't extend my Starter or Unleashed license? {#no-extension}

- You keep your license and can use your current version of Unraid OS indefinitely.
- You won't receive new feature updates or major version upgrades.
- You remain eligible for patch releases and security updates within the same minor version (e.g., 7.1.x if your license lapsed at 7.1.0).
- Once a new minor version is released (e.g., 7.2.0), only security patches are provided for the previous minor version.
- When a version reaches end-of-life (EOL), no further updates are provided.
- You can pay the extension fee at any time to regain access to the latest updates.

### What happens with pre-releases (Beta/RC versions)? {#pre-release-policy}

- Pre-release (Beta and Release Candidate) versions are for testing and may contain bugs.
- Only install pre-releases on non-production systems.
- Support for pre-releases ends when the stable version is released.
- Your license must be eligible for OS updates on the stable release date to receive the stable version.
- If your license expires before the stable release, you must extend your license to upgrade or roll back to a supported stable version.
- Your license remains valid after expiration; you only need an active license for new updates.

### What does "unlimited" mean for attached storage devices? {#unlimited-storage}

"Unlimited" refers to the maximum number of storage devices you can attach to your Unraid server, based on your license tier.

Here are the current limits:

| License Tier | %%Parity\|parity%%-Protected %%Array\|array%% | Named Pools | Devices per Pool | Total Storage Devices |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Starter      | Up to 6                                       | 1           | Up to 6          | 6                     |
| Unleashed    | Up to 30 (28 data + 2 %%parity\|parity%%)     | Up to 35    | Up to 60         | Unlimited\*           |
| Lifetime     | Up to 30 (28 data + 2 %%parity\|parity%%)     | Up to 35    | Up to 60         | Unlimited\*           |

\* *"Unlimited" means you are not limited by the license, but by hardware and OS constraints. Additional storage devices can be used for virtual machines, unassigned devices, or other Unraid features.*

## Troubleshooting

### What happens if my USB flash device fails? Do I have to repurchase a license? {#usb-failure-license}

No, you do not need to repurchase your license if your USB flash device fails.

To transfer your license:

1. Prepare a new, high-quality [USB flash device](../getting-started/set-up-unraid/create-your-bootable-media.mdx).
2. Install Unraid OS on the new device using the USB Flash Creator or a manual method.
3. Boot your server with the new flash device.
4. Go to ***Tools → Registration*** in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
5. Click **Replace Key** and follow the prompts to transfer your license to the new device.

The first transfer can be done at any time, while subsequent transfers are allowed once every 12 months using the automated system. If you need to transfer your license again before the 12-month period, contact Unraid support with your old and new USB %%GUID|guid%%s for manual assistance.

:::tip

Routinely back up your USB device using [Unraid Connect](../../unraid-connect/overview-and-setup.mdx) to simplify recovery and avoid data loss.

:::

### What should I do if I get an error registering my flash device: '####-####-####-#############' is already registered to another user? {#guid-error}

This error indicates that your USB flash device does not have a unique hardware ID (%%GUID|guid%%), which prevents it from being registered with the Unraid OS. To resolve this issue, use a different USB flash drive. Brands known for having unique %%GUID|guid%%s include Lexar, Samsung, Kingston, and PNY.

## Trial Licenses

### How do Unraid trials work? {#trial-license}

- Trial licenses last 30 days and provide full Unraid functionality without a storage device limit.
- You'll need a quality USB flash drive and the Unraid USB Creator tool.
- Consult the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started/set-up-unraid/create-your-bootable-media.mdx) for server setup instructions.
- Trial licenses require an internet connection at boot for initial validation.
- You can extend your trial for 15 more days if you need more time to evaluate Unraid. You can do this twice for a total of 60 days (details below).

### How do I Extend My Trial? {#extend-trial}

-Unraid trial registration keys last for 30 days and can be extended twice for 14 additional days each time.  After two trial extensions, no additional extensions can be granted.  To request an extension, you must stop the array, navigate to the Tools > Registration page, and click "Request Extension."

-If the two additional extension were not used, and this option does not appear for you, or if it's not working for any reason, please send us the flash drive GUID from Tools - Registration over to [contact@unraid.net](mailto:contact@unraid.net), or via our support portal at support.unraid.net and we will be happy to assist.

### Can I transfer my trial key to a new flash device? {#trial-key-transfer}

No, trial registrations are only valid on the original USB flash device. If you want to purchase a license, you can transfer your configuration to a new flash device and then purchase a registration key; however, the trial cannot be continued on a new device.
