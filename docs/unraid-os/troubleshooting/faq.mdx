## Build & Hardware

<a id="build-help" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>I need help with a build or system configuration. Where do I go?</h3></a>

  For guidance on building or upgrading your Unraid server, visit the [Compulsive Design forum](https://forums.unraid.net/forum/35-unraid-compulsive-design/) or join the [Unraid Discord](https://discord.unraid.net). The community is active and ready to assist you, no matter your level of experience.

<a id="hardware-raid-support" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>What controllers are recommended for Unraid?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  Unraid performs best with non-%%RAID|raid%% Host Bus Adapters (HBAs). It's best to avoid hardware %%RAID|raid%% controllers, which can obscure drive health information and complicate maintenance.

  Always check for firmware updates and ensure the controller is set to HBA/IT mode, not %%RAID|raid%% mode. You can refer to the [Recommended Controllers thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/102010-recommended-controllers-for-unraid/) for models that the community has tested successfully.

</details>

<br />

<a id="add-more-storage" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>What's the best way to add more storage if my built-in controller is full?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  Unraid allows for the expansion of storage across multiple controllers. You can add a compatible HBA (as mentioned above). Ensure the controller operates in standard HBA (non-%%RAID|raid%%) mode and supports %%AHCI|ahci%%/SATA. Avoid using %%RAID|raid%%-only cards, as Unraid requires direct disk access for %%parity|parity%% and monitoring.

</details>

<br />

<a id="bad-sector-allocation" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>Does Unraid have an allocation feature that remembers bad sectors on drives to prevent writes to them?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  Unraid utilizes %%SMART|smart%% data from your drives to monitor their health and detect issues such as bad sectors. %%SMART|smart%% is built into modern hard drives and SSDs, tracking attributes such as reallocated and pending sectors.

  While Unraid doesn't have a specific allocation feature to avoid bad sectors, it does use %%SMART|smart%% data to notify you if a drive displays signs of failure or has an increasing number of bad sectors. This information can be found in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% under the drive's health status and %%SMART|smart%% attributes.

  If a drive shows a high count of reallocated or pending sectors, consider replacing it soon to prevent data loss.

  If you're uncertain about a drive's health, you can share your %%SMART|smart%% data in the [General Support forum](https://forums.unraid.net/forum/55-general-support/) for assistance from the community.

## OS & Configuration

<a id="hasp-key-vm" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>Can I use a HASP key within a VM on Unraid? How does that work with multiple VMs?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  If your HASP key is a USB dongle, you can assign it to only one %%VM|vm%% at a time. Note that two %%VM|vm%%s cannot use the same key simultaneously. You might need to pass through an entire USB controller for better compatibility. Always run tests with a Trial license to confirm that your hardware performs as expected.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  If you had [Unraid Connect](../../unraid-connect/overview-and-setup.mdx) enabled for Flash Backups, you can use it to restore. If not, get a new, high-quality flash drive, install Unraid on it, and use the registration key you received via email. Reassign your drives as they were.

  1. Backup any data you wish to keep.
  2. Stop the %%array|array%% and shut down your server.
  3. Remove the USB flash device.
  4. Use the Unraid USB Flash Creator tool to reformat and reinstall Unraid onto the flash drive.
  5. Reinsert the flash device and boot your server.
  6. In the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, open a terminal and run `lsblk` to list all drives (excluding the flash).
  7. Wipe existing filesystems from each data drive:

  :::danger[Critical: Destructive Operation]

  **This step will permanently erase ALL data on the specified drive(s) and is IRREVERSIBLE!**

  - **Verify you have backups** of any data you need before proceeding
  - **Double-check the device identifier** in the WebGUI or with `lsblk` before running this command
  - **Ensure you're targeting the correct drive** - data loss from the wrong drive cannot be recovered

  For each data drive, run:

  ```
  wipefs /dev/sdX
  ```

  Replace `X` with the correct drive letter (e.g., sda, sdb, sdc)

  :::

  8. Continue with the normal Unraid setup and configuration.

<a id="change-hostname" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>How do I change the hostname of my server?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  To change your Unraid server's hostname, navigate the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to ***Settings → System Settings → Identification***.

  **Effects of changing your hostname:**

  - The new hostname will be used for network identification (e.g., access via `http://newname`).
  - You might need to reconnect any mapped network drives or shortcuts using the new hostname.
  - Some devices or services may cache the old name; a full device reboot may be required to recognize the new name.

<a id="invalid-guid" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>My flash drive is reporting an invalid GUID. What do I do?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  Unraid requires a USB flash device with a unique hardware %%GUID|guid%% (serial number). Some manufacturers may reuse %%GUID|guid%%s or use generic values, making these drives incompatible with each other.

  **Field-tested brands:**

  - Samsung FIT Plus / Bar Plus
  - Kingston DataTraveler Exodia
  - Lexar JumpDrive M45
  - PNY Elite-X
    (Avoid newer SanDisk Ultra Fit/Cruzer models unless you can confirm a unique %%GUID|guid%%.)

  It's best to avoid generic or unbranded drives, SSDs, USB card readers, and SD card adapters, as these often lack unique %%GUID|guid%%s and may not be supported for booting Unraid.

<a id="mbr-to-gpt-conversion" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>I currently have an array of devices formatted with an MBR-style partition table and want to convert to GPT. How do I do that?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  <h3>Why convert from MBR to GPT?</h3>
  MBR (Master Boot Record) partitioning supports disks up to 2TB and only allows a maximum of four primary partitions. On the other hand, GPT (%%GUID|guid%% Partition Table) can handle much larger disks and nearly unlimited partitions. Converting to GPT is advisable if you work with larger drives or want better partition management.

  :::important[Use **Maintenance Mode**]

  Before starting the conversion process, put your %%array|array%% into **Maintenance Mode**. This step ensures no writes occur during the conversion, protecting your data.

  :::
  <h3>Conversion process</h3>

  1. Ensure you have a valid %%parity|parity%% and a current backup of your flash drive.
  2. Enter **Maintenance Mode** from the ***Main*** tab.
  3. Replace and rebuild your %%parity|parity%% drive first.
  4. Swap out each data drive one at a time, rebuilding the %%array|array%% after each replacement.
  5. The new drive will be formatted with the appropriate partitioning style based on its size:
     - **2TB or smaller**: Uses MBR partitioning
     - **Larger than 2TB**: Uses GPT partitioning
  6. Once all drives are replaced and rebuilt, exit **Maintenance Mode**.

  This process keeps your data safe while changing the partitioning style.

  :::note[Additional notes]

  - **Partitioning is automatic**: Unraid automatically chooses the partitioning style based on drive size:
    - **2TB or smaller**: Always uses MBR partitioning
    - **Larger than 2TB**: Always uses GPT partitioning
  - Starting with Unraid OS 6.9, partition 1 starts at 32KiB for rotational devices and 1MiB for non-rotational devices, regardless of the partition style.
  - Always [back up your flash drive](../system-administration/secure-your-server/secure-your-flash-drive.mdx#backups) before starting this conversion process.

## Networking

<a id="disable-br0-bridge" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>Is there any way to disable the br0 bridge?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  Yes. The **br0** bridge is a Linux network bridge allowing Docker containers and %%VM|vm%%s to connect directly to your local area network (LAN) with their IP addresses. It acts as a virtual network switch that connects your physical network interface to the virtual interfaces used by containers and %%VM|vm%%s.

  :::note

  Disabling br0 means that %%VMs|vm%% and Docker containers will not have direct access to the LAN and may lose some advanced networking features.

<a id="webgui-connection" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>I can't seem to connect to the WebGUI using `http://tower` or `http://tower.local`. What do I do?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  If you're having trouble connecting to the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% by hostname, the issue might be with your local DNS not resolving the server name. Instead, try connecting directly using the IP address.

  **How to find your server's IP address:**

  - Check your router or switch's DHCP client list for a device listed as "Tower" or something similar.
  - If you assigned a static IP during flash creation, use that address.
  - Plug in a monitor and keyboard to your server; the IP address will appear on the local console after it boots.

  **Common causes for this issue:**

  - Your computer and server might be on different subnets or VLANs.
  - Your router may not support local hostname resolution.
  - The Unraid server might not be connected to the network or have a misconfigured network setting.
  - Firewall or security software may be blocking access.

  If you are unable to connect, try rebooting your server and network equipment, and ensure that all cables are securely connected.

## Installation

<a id="usb-creator-issue" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>I can't get the USB flash creator to install Unraid on my flash device. What do I do?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  If the USB flash creator tool isn't working for your system or flash drive, you can utilize the [manual installation method](../getting-started/set-up-unraid/create-your-bootable-media.mdx#manual-install-method) to prepare your Unraid boot device. This method is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Debian/Ubuntu Linux.

<a id="uefi-boot-config" class="anchor-fix" style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}><h3>I need to configure my system to boot using UEFI. How do I do this?</h3></a>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  You can set up %%UEFI|uefi%% boot mode in a few different ways:

  **Option 1: During flash creation**

  - When using the USB flash creator, select the option to enable %%UEFI|uefi%% boot mode before writing Unraid to the flash drive.

  **Option 2: After booting in Legacy Mode**

  - In the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, head to the Flash Device ***Settings → Flash Device*** page.
  - Enable %%UEFI|uefi%% boot mode and reboot your server.

  **Option 3: Manual folder rename**

  If you need more time with your [30-day free trial](https://unraid.net/download) of Unraid, you can extend it. Once your original trial expires, stop the %%array|array%% and go to the **Registration** page. You should see a button that allows you to request a 15-day extension. You can do this twice for a total of 60 days before you need to purchase a license.

  :::important

  You must use the same USB flash device to continue your trial. Changing the flash device will require starting a new trial from scratch.
