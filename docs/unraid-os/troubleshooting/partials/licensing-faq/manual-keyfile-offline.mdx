1. Ensure you have a recent backup of your USB drive. Use [Unraid Connect](../../../../unraid-connect/overview-and-setup.mdx) (recommended) or the local backup option at ***Main → Flash → Flash Backup***.
2. Shut down your Unraid server and remove the USB flash device.
3. Insert the USB flash into another computer.
4. Open the USB drive and copy your `.key` file into the `/config` folder.
   *Make sure this is the only `.key` file present—delete any others.*
5. Safely eject the USB flash device, reinstall it in your server, and reboot.
