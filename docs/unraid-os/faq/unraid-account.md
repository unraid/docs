# Unraid Account

## What is an Unraid.net Account?

An [Unraid.net account](https://account.unraid.net/) is the
account you create to use the [Unraid
forums](https://forums.unraid.net/) and the account used to sign in to
[Unraid Connect](/connect/about.md). This account is _not
the same_ as your server's root password that you use to login to the
Unraid WebGUI.
