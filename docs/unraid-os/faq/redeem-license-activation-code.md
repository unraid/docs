# Redeem License Activation Code

First, buy an activation code via [our website](https://unraid.net/pricing). Your unique activation code will be on your purchase receipt.

Next, follow our [Getting Started](../manual/getting-started.md) guide to set up an Unraid server.

Once your server is up and running:

1. Login to your Unraid server's webgui. (<http://tower> or
   <http://tower.local> from Mac by default)
2. For Unraid 6.10 and newer, Sign in to your Unraid.net account (or
   [create one](https://account.unraid.net/)) from the
   top-right of the webgui and select "Redeem Activation Code" and enter the activation code to
   activate your license. For Unraid 6.9 and older, navigate to the
   Tools -\> Registration page in the webGui and click "Purchase Key."
3. Select the corresponding license you purchased via activation code
   and enter the activation code in the "Your Activation Code" box to
   complete the activation process. Your registration key will be
   emailed to you with instructions for installation! _Note: Activation
   Codes are one-time use for generating your Unraid license keyfile._
