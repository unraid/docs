# Managing & customizing containers

:::caution[Disclaimer]

This page is written to help users of all skill levels make the most out of Docker containers on Unraid OS. The tips and best practices come from the Unraid team, who ensure they are tailored to most users' needs. However, keep in mind that Docker is constantly evolving, so for the most up-to-date features, advanced configurations, or troubleshooting issues that go beyond what Unraid covers, it's always a good idea to check the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

:::

Before customizing a Docker container in Unraid, it’s helpful to understand the basic configuration options. Each [container template](./community-applications.mdx) provides a user-friendly interface for setting up networking, storage, and environment variables, allowing you to tailor the container's behavior to your needs without using complex command-line tools.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Network type" label="Network type">

    Unraid supports several Docker network modes. The network type you choose determines how your container communicates with other devices and containers:

    - **Bridge (default):** The container is placed on an internal Docker network. Only ports you explicitly map will be accessible from your Unraid server or LAN. This is the safest and most common option for most applications.

    - **Host:** The container shares the Unraid server’s network stack. It can use any available port, but you must ensure no port conflicts with other services. Use this mode only if the application requires direct network access.

    - **None:** The container has no network access. Use this for isolated workloads that do not require any network connectivity.

    - **Custom (macvlan/ipvlan):** The container is assigned its own IP address on your LAN, making it appear as a separate device. This is useful for advanced scenarios but may require additional configuration in your network environment.

    :::tip

    The default network type specified in the container’s template is recommended for most users.

    :::

    :::caution[Wi-Fi and Docker Networking Limitations]

    Docker has a limitation that prevents it from participating in two networks that share the same subnet. If you switch between a wired and a wireless connection, you will need to restart Docker and reconfigure all existing containers to use the new interface. This [network configuration](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/securing-your-connection.mdx) change requires container reconfiguration.

    :::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Volume mappings" label="Volume mappings">

    Volume mappings control how your container accesses files on your Unraid server. Each mapping links a folder inside the container (container path) to a folder on your Unraid server (host path).

    - **Container path:** The directory inside the container (e.g., `/config` or `/unraid_media`).
    - **Host path:** The directory on your Unraid server (e.g., `/mnt/user/appdata/myapp`).
    - **Access mode:** Controls permissions - read-only or read/write. Use the most restrictive mode that still allows the container to function.

    :::tip[Best practice]

    Store application data (settings, libraries, etc.) outside the container, typically in the `appdata` %%user share|user-share%%. This [share management](../manage-storage/shares.mdx) approach keeps your data safe during updates or reinstalls.

    :::

    :::note

    - Paths are case-sensitive.
    - Container paths should start with a `/`.
    - If using an unassigned device as the host path, set the access mode to a "Slave" option to ensure proper detection.
    - Host paths are created automatically if they do not exist when the container starts.
    - Unexpected folders appearing on your server may indicate a misconfigured mapping.

    :::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Port mappings" label="Port mappings">

    Port mappings determine how network traffic is routed from your Unraid server to the container.

    - **Bridge network:** You can map internal container ports to different host ports. For example, if three containers use port 8000 internally, you can map them to 8000, 8001, and 8002 on the host.

    - **Host network:** The container can use any available port. Avoid running multiple containers with the same port to prevent conflicts.

    :::important

    Only modify the host port value. Do not change the container port unless you know the application supports it.

    :::
    Most templates provide sensible defaults, but you can add or adjust port mappings.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Environment variables" label="Environment variables">

    Environment variables can customize how your Docker container behaves at runtime. They allow you to pass key-value pairs that your containerized application can read and utilize.

    <h4>Common uses for environment variables</h4>

    - Setting the time zone
    - Configuring user and group IDs
    - Specifying language preferences
    - Adjusting application-specific settings, like API keys or feature toggles

    <h4>Managing environment variables in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%</h4>

    - You can add, edit, or remove environment variables in the container's configuration screen through the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
    - Many container templates come with common environment variables that are already set, but you can always add more if needed.
    - Be sure to check the specific application’s documentation to know which environment variables are available and which values are valid.

    :::info[Examples of environment variables]

    - `TZ=America/New_York`: This sets the container's time zone.
    - `PUID=99` and `PGID=100`: These set the user and group IDs for file permissions.
    - `UMASK=022`: This controls the default file permissions for created files.
    - `API_KEY=your_api_key_here`: This could be used by an application for authentication with an external service.

    :::

    :::tip

    Use environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive or environment-specific information inside your container images. This practice enhances the portability and security of your containers.

## Creating and starting containers

Once you've configured your container’s network, volume mappings, port mappings, and environment variables, you're ready to create and launch your Docker container. This section will guide you through the creation process, explain how to manage startup order and dependencies, and provide tips for advanced startup customization.

### Creating a container

After reviewing your configuration settings in the container template:

1. Click **Create** to begin downloading and setting up the container.
   - Avoid closing your browser window or navigating away until the process completes.
   - The initial download for a new repository may take longer than subsequent downloads.
2. Once the process is finished, click **Done** to return to the Docker page, where you can manage or add more containers.

### Planning your startup sequence

Some containers depend on others to function correctly. For example, an application might need a database container running first, or a service might require a [%%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% container](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/tailscale.mdx) to be active before it starts.

:::important[Plan your startup]

- Identify containers that provide core services (like databases, %%VPNs|vpn-tunnel%%, or storage gateways).
- Ensure dependent containers are started only after their prerequisites are running and ready.
- Review documentation for each container to understand any specific startup requirements.

:::

---

## Advanced container startup

Unraid gives you flexible control over which containers start automatically and in what order. This is especially useful if you have containers that depend on others (such as a database or %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% service).

To ensure a container starts automatically when the %%array|array%% starts:

1. Go to the **Docker** tab in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
2. Toggle the **Auto-Start** switch to **ON** for each container you want to launch automatically.

### Customize startup order and delays

By default, Unraid starts all auto-start containers as quickly as possible, in the order they appear on the Docker tab. You can customize this order and add wait times between container startups:

1. On the **Docker** tab, unlock the container list using the padlock icon.
2. Drag and drop containers to rearrange their order.
3. Switch to **Advanced View** using the toggle at the top right.
4. In the **AutoStart** column, enter a wait time (in seconds) in the **wait** field for any container that needs extra time before the next one starts.
   - Use trial and error to determine the best wait times for your setup.

:::tip

Setting the correct order and wait times is especially important for containers that depend on services provided by others (for example, starting a database before an app that uses it, or a %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% before dependent apps).

:::

### Testing your startup sequence

While Unraid does not have a dedicated "test startup sequence" feature, you can simulate and verify your startup order:

1. Stop all containers from the **Docker** tab.
2. Start each container manually, in your planned order, using the **Start** button.
3. Monitor container logs and application behavior to ensure dependencies are met and services initialize as expected.
4. Adjust the startup order or wait times as needed.

:::important

Test your startup sequence after changing container dependencies or adding new services, especially if your setup relies on specific startup timing.

## Controlling your containers

Once you've created and started your Docker container, managing it is easy through the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. This guide will walk you through using the context menu, understanding container health indicators, and accessing volume mappings within your container.

To access the container's context menu, go to the **Docker** or **Dashboard** tab and click on the container icon you want to manage. This menu offers straightforward access to common actions:

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '286px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![Docker Guide - Controlling](/img/Dockerguide-controlling.png)
</div>

| Option                       | Description                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WebUI**                    | Opens the container’s web interface in a new browser tab (if available).                            |
| **Update**                   | Appears when an update is available. Updates the container to the latest image.                     |
| **Start/Stop**               | Starts or stops the container.                                                                      |
| **Logs**                     | Shows the container’s log output for troubleshooting.                                               |
| **Edit**                     | Change container settings, such as port or volume mappings. Changes apply immediately after saving. |
| **Enable/Disable autostart** | Sets whether the container starts automatically when the %%array\|array%% starts.                   |
| **Remove**                   | Deletes the container. You can choose to remove just the container or also delete its image.        |

:::tip

Some containers may offer additional options, like direct links to documentation or support resources.

:::

### Health indicator

You will find a colored health indicator next to each container’s icon:

- 🟢 **Healthy**: Indicates that the container is running and responding as expected.
- 🟡 **Unhealthy**: The container is running but has failed its health check. Investigate the logs or container settings for more information.
- ⚪ **No health check**: This means no health check is configured for the container. It's common for many apps, and not necessarily a problem.

:::note

Health checks are defined by the container author and may not be present for all images.

:::

## Volume mappings inside a container

When configuring your application through its web interface, reference the **container path** you set up during configuration - not the host path.

For instance, if you mapped `/mnt/user/media` on the host to `/unraid_media` in the container, you should use `/unraid_media` in the application’s settings.

<h3>Example scenarios</h3>

Here are some examples showing common path mapping configurations that users frequently need when setting up Docker containers. They demonstrate how to translate between Unraid's host file system paths and the container's internal paths, helping you configure applications correctly.

- **Media server**:
  Host path: `/mnt/user/media`\
  Container path: `/unraid_media`\
  In the app, set your media library location to `/unraid_media`.

- **Appdata storage**:
  Host path: `/mnt/user/appdata/myapp`\
  Container path: `/config`\
  In the app, use `/config` for configuration storage.

- Multiple %%user shares|user-share%%:
  Host path: `/mnt/user/downloads` → Container path: `/downloads`\
  Host path: `/mnt/user/torrents` → Container path: `/torrents`\
  Reference `/downloads` or `/torrents` in the application as needed.

:::important[Best practice]

Always use the most restrictive [access mode](../manage-storage/shares.mdx) (read-only or read/write) that allows your container to function properly.

## Scheduling start and stop

Unraid does not natively support scheduled start or stop actions for **Docker containers**, but you can easily automate this process using the [**User Scripts plugin**](../customize-your-experience/plugins.mdx). This powerful tool allows you to run custom scripts on a schedule, enabling automatic control of your containers.

### User Scripts plugin

The **User Scripts plugin** allows you to create, manage, and schedule custom shell scripts directly from the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. You can use it for various automation tasks, such as starting or stopping containers, backing up data, or running maintenance routines.

- Install the plugin from the **Apps** tab if you haven’t done so already.
- Access it via ***Settings → User Scripts*** to create and manage your scripts.

To learn more about plugins, check out [Plugins](../customize-your-experience/plugins.mdx).

### Scheduling container actions

To automate the start or stop of your containers on a schedule:

1. Install the **User Scripts plugin** from the **Apps** tab.
2. Navigate to ***Settings → User Scripts***.
3. Create a new script for each unique schedule. You can include commands for multiple containers in a single script if they share the same schedule.
4. Set the schedule using the dropdown menu or use a custom `cron` expression for more advanced timing options.
5. Click **Apply** to save and activate your script.

:::tip

Cron expressions enable flexible scheduling beyond the built-in options. For example, `0 3 * * 1` runs your script at 3:00 AM every Monday.
