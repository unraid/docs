# Overview

Docker allows you to run Linux applications in isolated environments known as "containers." On Unraid, Docker is the ideal method for deploying and managing a wide variety of applications without concerns about compatibility or system conflicts. This approach transforms your Unraid server into a flexible %%application server|application-server%%, enabling you to run popular apps like **Plex**, **Home Assistant**, and many more directly on your system.

If you want to learn more about Docker's foundational technology or explore advanced usage, check out the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

## How Unraid uses Docker

Unraid’s Docker integration is designed to be user-friendly for everyone. Each application runs in its own container, ensuring that updates or changes don’t affect your Unraid OS or other applications. Unraid utilizes a dedicated `appdata` share to store each container’s settings and working files. This keeps your application data organized and makes backups and migrations simple.

  Unraid uses Docker to create separate environments for running Linux-based applications. Each Docker container operates independently from the Unraid operating system and other containers, which enhances both stability and compatibility.

  <h4>Implementation details</h4>

  - **Storage:** All the data and programs for each container are stored in a single %%virtual disk image|virtual-disk-images%% file called `docker.img`. By default, this file is found in the `system` %%user share|user-share%%, which usually utilizes the %%cache pool|cache-pool%% for better speed.
  - **File system:** The `docker.img` file uses the %%BTRFS|btrfs%% file system and is mounted internally by Unraid. For more information on file systems, see [File systems](../manage-storage/file-systems.mdx).
  - **Configuration:** When you set up a container, Unraid saves your configuration as a %%VM XML template|vm-xml-templates%% on the flash drive. This makes it easy to reinstall or restore containers with your preferred settings.
  - **Templates:** Many popular containers come with ready-made templates, making the initial setup less complicated.
  - **Performance:** It’s a good idea to store `docker.img` on the %%cache pool|cache-pool%% (if you have one) for the best performance.
  - **Limitations:** Unraid does not natively support Docker Compose. For more complex setups, check out the [official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

  :::tip
  Most users won’t need to interact with the `docker.img` file directly. However, knowing its role can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding log messages.

## Community Applications (Plugin)

The Community Applications plugin is the easiest and most popular way to discover, install, and manage both Docker containers and plugins on your Unraid server. It provides an app store-like experience directly in the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, making it simple to browse and deploy a wide range of community-maintained applications.

For a complete guide to installing and using the Community Applications plugin, including advanced features and troubleshooting, check out [Community Applications](./community-applications.mdx).

:::note Notes and Support

- Most containers in Community Applications are maintained by the broader Unraid and Docker communities.
- For assistance with a specific container, check its documentation or support thread linked in the **Apps** tab.
- Lime Technology provides support for the Docker subsystem itself but does not support individual community containers.
