Environment variables can customize how your Docker container behaves at runtime. They allow you to pass key-value pairs that your containerized application can read and utilize.

<h4>Common uses for environment variables</h4>

- Setting the time zone
- Configuring user and group IDs
- Specifying language preferences
- Adjusting application-specific settings, like API keys or feature toggles

<h4>Managing environment variables in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%</h4>

- You can add, edit, or remove environment variables in the container's configuration screen through the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
- Many container templates come with common environment variables that are already set, but you can always add more if needed.
- Be sure to check the specific applicationâ€™s documentation to know which environment variables are available and which values are valid.

:::info[Examples of environment variables]

- `TZ=America/New_York`: This sets the container's time zone.
- `PUID=99` and `PGID=100`: These set the user and group IDs for file permissions.
- `UMASK=022`: This controls the default file permissions for created files.
- `API_KEY=your_api_key_here`: This could be used by an application for authentication with an external service.

:::tip

Use environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive or environment-specific information inside your container images. This practice enhances the portability and security of your containers.
