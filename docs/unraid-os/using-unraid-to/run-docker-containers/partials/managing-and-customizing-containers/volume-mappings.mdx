Volume mappings control how your container accesses files on your Unraid server. Each mapping links a folder inside the container (container path) to a folder on your Unraid server (host path).

- **Container path:** The directory inside the container (e.g., `/config` or `/unraid_media`).
- **Host path:** The directory on your Unraid server (e.g., `/mnt/user/appdata/myapp`).
- **Access mode:** Controls permissions - read-only or read/write. Use the most restrictive mode that still allows the container to function.

:::tip[Best practice]

Store application data (settings, libraries, etc.) outside the container, typically in the `appdata` %%user share|user-share%%. This [share management](/unraid-os/using-unraid-to/manage-storage/shares) approach keeps your data safe during updates or reinstalls.

:::

:::note

- Paths are case-sensitive.
- Container paths should start with a `/`.
- If using an unassigned device as the host path, set the access mode to a "Slave" option to ensure proper detection.
- Host paths are created automatically if they do not exist when the container starts.
- Unexpected folders appearing on your server may indicate a misconfigured mapping.
