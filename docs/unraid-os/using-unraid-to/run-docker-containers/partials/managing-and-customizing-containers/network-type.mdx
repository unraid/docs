Unraid supports several Docker network modes. The network type you choose determines how your container communicates with other devices and containers:

- **Bridge (default):** The container is placed on an internal Docker network. Only ports you explicitly map will be accessible from your Unraid server or LAN. This is the safest and most common option for most applications.

- **Host:** The container shares the Unraid server’s network stack. It can use any available port, but you must ensure no port conflicts with other services. Use this mode only if the application requires direct network access.

- **None:** The container has no network access. Use this for isolated workloads that do not require any network connectivity.

- **Custom (macvlan/ipvlan):** The container is assigned its own IP address on your LAN, making it appear as a separate device. This is useful for advanced scenarios but may require additional configuration in your network environment.

:::tip
The default network type specified in the container’s template is recommended for most users.

:::caution[Wi-Fi and Docker Networking Limitations]
Docker has a limitation that prevents it from participating in two networks that share the same subnet. If you switch between a wired and a wireless connection, you will need to restart Docker and reconfigure all existing containers to use the new interface. This [network configuration](/unraid-os/system-administration/secure-your-server/securing-your-connection) change requires container reconfiguration.
