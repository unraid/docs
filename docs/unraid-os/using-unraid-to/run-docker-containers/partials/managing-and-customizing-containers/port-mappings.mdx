Port mappings determine how network traffic is routed from your Unraid server to the container.

- **Bridge network:** You can map internal container ports to different host ports. For example, if three containers use port 8000 internally, you can map them to 8000, 8001, and 8002 on the host.

- **Host network:** The container can use any available port. Avoid running multiple containers with the same port to prevent conflicts.

:::important

Only modify the host port value. Do not change the container port unless you know the application supports it.

Most templates provide sensible defaults, but you can add or adjust port mappings.
