If you need to reinstall a Docker container or plugin (for instance, if your `docker.img` file is corrupted), Community Applications simplifies this for you. All application settings are saved as Docker template XML files in `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user`. For more information on the Docker template XML schema and custom tags, see the [Docker Template XML Schema documentation](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/38619-docker-template-xml-schema/) on the Unraid forums.

To reinstall an application:

1. Go to the **Apps** tab in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
2. Select the **Previous Apps** filter.
3. Find the application you wish to reinstall and follow the prompts.

Your saved settings will be restored automatically, allowing for a quick and easy recovery.
