The parity-preserve method allows you to remove a data disk from your Unraid array without losing your parity protection. This process requires careful preparation and some technical knowledge and is only recommended for advanced users.

<h4>What this method does</h4>

This method effectively zeros out the data disk you want to remove, allowing you to keep your parity intact. Since a disk filled with zeroes does not affect parity, your array remains protected throughout the procedure.

<h4>When to use this method</h4>

Use the %%parity|parity%%-preserve method to remove a data disk while keeping your %%parity|parity%% valid safely. This is especially useful to avoid a full %%parity|parity%% sync after removal. Please ensure that the disk you're removing is healthy.

:::important[Prerequisites]

Before you begin, ensure that you meet the following conditions:

- This method allows you to remove only one disk at a time.
- Note that there is no official support from LimeTech for this process; please proceed with caution.

:::

:::warning

This method will erase all data on the selected disk. Please verify that all important data has been moved before proceeding.

To remove a disk using the parity-preserve method:

1. **Start the array in maintenance mode:** Click on the disk you want to remove and then click the **Erase** button. This will erase the file system from the device while still maintaining parity, then stop the array.
2. **Start the array:** Start the array in normal mode; the disk to be erased won't mount but the remaining disks will be online during the process.
3. **Record array assignments:** Note your array assignments, especially the %%parity drive|parity-drives%%, as a safety measure.
4. **(Optional) Enable Turbo Write:** For faster zeroing, enable Reconstruct Write ("Turbo Write") in **Settings → Disk Settings**, but only if all drives are healthy.
5. **Zero out the disk:** Use the alternative command-line method below to manually zero out the disk.
6. **Stop the array:** Once the clearing is complete, stop the array.
7. **Reset array configuration:** Retain all current assignments when resetting the array configuration.
8. **Unassign the disk:** Unassign the disk you wish to remove, double-checking all assignments, especially the %%parity drive|parity-drives%%.
9. **Confirm parity status:** Check the box indicating "Parity is already valid."
10. **Start the array again:** Start the array to finish the removal process.
11. **(Optional) Verify parity:** You can run a correcting %%parity check|parity-check%% afterward to ensure parity integrity.

  <summary>**Alternative command-line method for zeroing a disk**</summary>

  If you're comfortable using the Linux command line, you can manually zero out your disk using the following instructions. Be sure to choose the command that corresponds with your version of Unraid.

  Since zeroing a disk can take many hours, it's recommended to use something like the [Tmux Terminal Manager TTM plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/183427-plugin-tmux-terminal-manager-ttm/) to type the commands and make sure the session remains up.

  **For Unraid 6.12 or later:**

  1. First, unmount the disk:
     ```bash
     umount /mnt/diskX
     ```
  2. Zero out the disk with the following command:
     ```bash
     dd bs=1M if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mdXp1 status=progress
     ```

  **For Unraid 6.11 and earlier:**

  1. Start by unmounting the disk:
     ```bash
     umount /mnt/diskX
     ```
  2. Next, use this command to zero out the disk:
     ```bash
     dd bs=1M if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mdX status=progress
     ```

  :::note

  Remember to replace `X` with the specific number of the data disk you are removing.

  :::

  :::caution

  Before executing these commands, double-check the drive number to avoid accidentally erasing data on the wrong disk.
