The parity-preserve method allows you to remove a data disk from your Unraid array without losing your parity protection. This process requires careful preparation and some technical knowledge and is only recommended for advanced users.

<h4>What this method does</h4>

This method effectively zeros out the data disk you want to remove, allowing you to keep your parity intact. Since a disk filled with zeroes does not affect parity, your array remains protected throughout the procedure.

<h4>When to use this method</h4>

Use the %%parity|parity%%-preserve method to remove a data disk while keeping your %%parity|parity%% valid safely. This is especially useful to avoid a full %%parity|parity%% sync after removal. Please ensure that the disk you're removing is healthy.

:::important[Prerequisites]

Before you begin, ensure that you meet the following conditions:

- This method allows you to remove only one disk at a time.
- Note that there is no official support from LimeTech for this process; please proceed with caution.

:::

:::warning

This method will erase all data on the selected disk. Please verify that all important data has been moved before proceeding.

To remove a disk using the parity-preserve method:

1. **Start the array in maintnance mode:** Click on the disk you want to remove and then click the **Erase** button. This will erase the file system from the device while still maintaining parity, then stop the array.
2. **Start the array:** Start the array in normal mode; the disk to be erased won't mount but the remaining disks will be online during the process.
3. **Record array assignments:** Note your array assignments, especially the %%parity drive|parity-drives%%, as a safety measure.
4. **(Optional) Enable Turbo Write:** For faster zeroing, enable Reconstruct Write ("Turbo Write") in **Settings â†’ Disk Settings**, but only if all drives are healthy.
5. **Zero out the disk:** Use the alternative command-line method below to manually zero out the disk.
6. **Stop the array:** Once the clearing is complete, stop the array.
7. **Reset array configuration:** Retain all current assignments when resetting the array configuration.
8. **Unassign the disk:** Unassign the disk you wish to remove, double-checking all assignments, especially the %%parity drive|parity-drives%%.
9. **Confirm parity status:** Check the box indicating "Parity is already valid."
10. **Start the array again:** Start the array to finish the removal process.
11. **(Optional) Verify parity:** You can run a correcting %%parity check|parity-check%% afterward to ensure parity integrity.
