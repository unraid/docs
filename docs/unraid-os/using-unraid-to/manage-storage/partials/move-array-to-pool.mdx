:::info[Common use case]

Moving files back to the %%cache pool|cache-pool%% after maintenance or when you've added a new cache device to improve performance.

:::
To move files from the %%array|array%% to a pool:

1. **Disable Docker and %%VM|vm%% services**: Go to **Settings** and turn off Docker and %%VM|vm%% Manager to prevent any open files from interfering.
2. **Set share storage and Mover action (array → cache)**: In the **Shares** tab, for each share you want to move (like `appdata` or `system`), set **Primary storage** to the destination %%cache pool|cache-pool%% and **Secondary storage** to the %%array|array%%. Set **Mover action** to **array → cache**.
3. **Run the %%Mover|mover%%**: Go to the **Main** tab and click **Move Now** to start moving files from the %%array|array%% to the %%cache pool|cache-pool%%.
4. **Verify the move**: After the %%Mover|mover%% finishes, check that the files are now on the %%cache pool|cache-pool%%.
5. **Re-enable Docker and %%VM|vm%% services**: Once the move is complete, turn Docker and %%VM|vm%% Manager back on in **Settings**.
6. **(Optional) Set share to use %%cache pool|cache-pool%% exclusively**: If you want all files for a share to remain on the %%cache pool|cache-pool%%, set the **Primary storage** to your %%cache pool|cache-pool%% and **Secondary storage** to **None** for that share.
