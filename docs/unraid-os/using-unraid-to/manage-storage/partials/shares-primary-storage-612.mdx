The **Primary Storage** setting determines where new files for a share are initially writtenâ€”this can be the **%%cache|cache%%**, the **%%array|array%%**, or any named **%%pool|cache-pool%%**. The **Secondary Storage** setting specifies an alternate location for new files and folders if the primary storage falls below the **Minimum Free Space** threshold.

The **%%Mover|mover%%** function automatically transfers files between primary and secondary storage based on your schedule, ensuring optimal performance and storage utilization.
