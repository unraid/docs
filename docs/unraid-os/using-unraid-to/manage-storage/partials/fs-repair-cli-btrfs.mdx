- To perform a %%scrub|scrub%% (which detects and repairs many errors automatically), start the %%array|array%% in **Normal mode** and run: `btrfs scrub start /mnt/diskX`.
- For a full repair, start the %%array|array%% in **%%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%%** and run: `btrfs check --repair /dev/mdXp1`. Only use `--repair` if advised by the [forums](https://forums.unraid.net/) or documentation, as it can sometimes lead to further issues.

:::caution[Use `--repair` with caution]
The `--repair` option can sometimes cause data loss or make corruption worse if used incorrectly. Only use it when:

- You've consulted the [Unraid forums](https://forums.unraid.net/) for your specific error
- You have a recent backup of your data
- You understand the risks involved

For most %%BTRFS|btrfs%% issues, try running a `scrub` first (which is safer) or seek expert advice before attempting repairs.
