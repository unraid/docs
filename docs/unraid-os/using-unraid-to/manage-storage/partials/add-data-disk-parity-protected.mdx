To add a data disk to a parity-protected array:

1. **Stop the array:** Use the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to stop the array.
2. **Turn off your server:** Power down your server safely.
3. **Install the new hard drive(s):** Add the new disk(s) physically.
4. **Power the server back on:** Start your server again.
5. **Assign the new disk(s):** Use the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to assign the new disks to available data slots.
6. **Start the array:** Start the array again.

   - Unraid will automatically start a **Clear operation** on the new disk. This fills the disk with zeros and ensures it's ready for use while maintaining data integrity.
   - The clear operation takes place in the background, so you can still access your array. However, the new disk won't be usable until the process is complete and the disk is formatted.
   - If you've pre-cleared the disk, Unraid will skip this step, recognizing that it's already ready to use.

7. **After Clearing Completes:** Once the clearing process is finished, the disk will show up as unmountable in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. You'll be prompted to format it.

:::important

Always double-check the serial number to make sure you're formatting the right disk. Formatting will erase everything on that disk, and this action cannot be undone.

8. **Confirm the Format:** Check the confirmation box and click the **Format** button. Unraid will give you a warning about the outcomes of this action.
9. **Formatting Process:** The formatting will take a few minutes. Once it's completed, the disk will show as mounted and ready for use. It's normal to see a small amount of used space due to file system overhead.

:::note

You can add multiple disks, but they won't be usable until all of them have been cleared and formatted.
