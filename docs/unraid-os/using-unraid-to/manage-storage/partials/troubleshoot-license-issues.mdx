`Invalid or missing registration key.`

![Missing Key](/img/Invalidormissingkey.png)

A valid registration key is required in order to start the array. To purchase or get a trial key:

1. Go to ***Tools â†’ Registration***.
2. Click **Get Trial Key** or **Purchase Key**.
3. Install the key by returning to **Registration**, pasting in the field, and clicking the **Install Key** button.

:::note[Trial vs. Paid Licenses]

- **Trial License:** Full Unraid access for 30 days, just like the higher license tiers. You can use unlimited storage devices, but you'll need an internet connection to start it up. [Start a new trial here.](https://unraid.net/getting-started)
- **Paid License:** This is yours to keep forever! However, there are limits on the number of devices based on the plan you choose (**Starter**, **Unleashed**, or **Lifetime**). After you activate it, you don't have to connect to the internet anymore.

:::tip

If you see an "invalid key" error, it might mean your trial has **expired**. To keep using Unraid, you can [purchase a license here](https://unraid.net/pricing).

:::caution[Blacklisted USB flash devices]

If your server is online and your trial hasn't run out, your USB flash drive might have a %%GUID|guid%% that can't register a key. This can happen if the %%GUID|guid%% isn't unique or has already registered by someone else. Using an SD card reader via USB can also cause this issue since it often has a generic %%GUID|guid%%. If your USB flash drive is **blacklisted**, it can't be used anymore, and you'll need to find a different device for your Unraid Server OS installation.
