![Device Limit Error](/img/Toomanydevices.png)

The rules for connecting storage apply only before starting the array. After the array is started, you can add more storage, including USB drives for virtual machines. However, be aware that Unraid currently only limits the number of attached storage devices on the [**Starter license tier**](https://unraid.net/pricing)
(6 device limit).

:::tip

The maximum applies to all devices except the boot USB.

:::

To resolve this error:

1. Stop the array.
2. Remove any unneeded storage devices.
3. Start the array.
4. Reconnect devices afterwards for **Unassigned Devices** use.
