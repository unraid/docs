The **Scrub** operation reads all data and metadata, checks the integrity of checksums, and repairs any corrupt blocks using available redundant copies. Scrubbing helps identify and fix silent data corruption, known as “bit rot,” before it becomes a significant issue.

<h4>When to run Scrub</h4>

- As part of routine maintenance (see recommended schedule below).
- After unclean shutdowns or if you suspect corruption.
- More frequently on high-usage pools.

<h4>Recommended schedule</h4>

- High-usage pools: **Once a week**
- All other pools: **Once a month**

<h4>How to run Scrub</h4>

1. **Access the pool**: In the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, click on the pool in the **Main** tab and select **Scrub**.
2. **Start the process**: Click **Start** to initiate the process.

:::note[Timing]

Scrub operations are usually quicker than a full disk scan because they only check allocated data. Based on pool size and usage, expect this to take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
