**Message:**
`Cannot contact key-server`

If you have a Trial license, you'll see a message indicating that you need to contact the Unraid license server to start your array. However, if you have a paid license, you can start the array without any extra steps.

For Trial users, your server tries to connect to the license key server to check your license when it first boots up. If it can't connect within 30 seconds, the array won't start. But don't worry! Each time you refresh or navigate the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, it will try again to validate your license quickly. Once it successfully validates, your server won't need to check again unless you reboot.
