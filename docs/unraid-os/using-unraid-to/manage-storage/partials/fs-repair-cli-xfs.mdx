- Start the %%array|array%% in **%%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%%**.
- Run the following command: `xfs_repair /dev/mdXp1`. Replace `X` with the disk number (e.g., `/dev/md1p1`).
- For encrypted %%XFS|xfs%%, use: `/dev/mapper/mdXp1`.
- If you're prompted to use `-L`, re-run the command like this: `xfs_repair -L /dev/mdXp1`. This is usually safe and necessary to complete the repair.
- For drives that are not part of the %%array|array%%: `xfs_repair /dev/sdX1`.

:::caution

Running this command on an %%array|array%% disk outside of **%%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%%** will invalidate parity.
