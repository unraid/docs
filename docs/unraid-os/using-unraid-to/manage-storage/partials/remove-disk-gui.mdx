:::note[Before you start]

- You can only remove one drive at a time using the GUI.
- Make sure your pool is using a redundant %%RAID|raid%% profile (like %%RAID 1|raid1%% for both data and metadata).
- To check your pool's %%RAID|raid%% level, navigate to the Main tab and click on the pool. Scroll down to the Balance Status section (for %%BTRFS|btrfs%%) or ZFS pool status (for %%ZFS|zfs%%).

To remove a disk using the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%:

1. **Stop the %%array|array%%**: Go to the **Main** tab and look for the option to stop your %%array|array%%.
2. **Unassign the pool drive**: Find the drive you want to remove and unassign it in the **Main** tab.
3. **Start the %%array|array%%**: Restart the %%array|array%% to apply the changes.
4. **Verify removal**: Click on the first pool device in the **Main** tab, then check **Balance Status** (for %%BTRFS|btrfs%%) or **zpool status** (for %%ZFS|zfs%%) to confirm the device was correctly removed.

:::note[Timing]

Keep in mind that removing a drive and rebalancing the pool may take several hours, depending on how much data you have and your device speeds.
