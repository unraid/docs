A %%read check|read-check%% is an important task you should perform under certain conditions to ensure the health of your storage array. This check is necessary **if your array does not have any parity devices assigned** or **if you have more disabled drives than available parity drives**.

During a %%read check|read-check%%, every sector of every disk in the array is examined. The goal is to verify that all data can be accessed and to identify any unrecoverable read errors.

<h4>Why read checks matter</h4>

Read checks are essential for monitoring the health of your disks, especially in configurations without parity protection. If a disk encounters an unrecoverable read error during the check, the affected data cannot be retrieved, which could lead to data loss. Therefore, keeping an eye on the results of these checks is crucial, and taking action when errors are reported is necessary.

You can also review the history of %%read check|read-check%% operations in the Unraid interface, which helps you spot trends or recurring issues over time.

<h4>When to use a read check</h4>

Consider running a %%read check|read-check%% in the following situations:

- **No parity devices assigned:** When your array lacks parity protection.
- **Verifying disk integrity:** To confirm the integrity of each disk without making any corrections.
- **Post-hardware issue resolution:** After fixing hardware issues, to ensure all disks are healthy.

<h4>What to do if errors are found</h4>

If your %%read check|read-check%% reports errors, here are some steps to follow:

1. **Review SMART reports:** Check the %%SMART reports|smart-report%% for the affected disks to understand their health status.
2. **Inspect connections:** Ensure that physical connections and cables are secure.
3. **Consider replacements:** If a disk shows persistent errors, think about replacing it.
4. **Backup critical data:** Move important data off any disks reporting errors as soon as possible to prevent data loss.

Without parity protection, any unrecoverable read error will lead to permanent data loss for the affected files or sectors.

To maintain the health of your disks, it's wise to **schedule regular %%read checks|read-check%%**, especially if your array does not have parity protection. This proactive measure will help you catch potential issues early and safeguard your data.
