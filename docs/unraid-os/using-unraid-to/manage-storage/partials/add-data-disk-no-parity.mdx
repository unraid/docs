To add a data disk to an array without parity protection:

1. **Stop the array:** Use the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to stop the array.
2. **Turn off your server:** Power down your server safely.
3. **Install the new hard drive(s):** Add the new disk(s) physically.
4. **Power the server back on:** Start your server again.
5. **Assign the new disk(s):** Use the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to assign the new disks to available data slots.
6. **Start the array:** Start the array again.

   - The clearing step is skipped entirely when there is no %%parity disk|parity-drives%% in the array.

7. **Format the Disk:** The new disk will show up as unmountable in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. You'll be prompted to format it.

Always double-check the serial number to make sure you're formatting the right disk. Formatting will erase everything on that disk, and this action cannot be undone.
