To check a %%ZFS|zfs%% file system via the command line:

<h4>Recommended method</h4>

%%ZFS|zfs%% uses **scrubbing** instead of traditional filesystem checks like `fsck`. A %%scrub|scrub%% examines all data in the pool to verify checksums and automatically repairs any corruption found on redundant configurations.

- Start the %%array|array%% in **Normal mode** and run: `zpool scrub poolname`
  - Replace `poolname` with your actual %%ZFS|zfs%% pool name.

<h4>Check pool status</h4>
To view the current health and any ongoing %%scrub|scrub%% progress, use the command: `zpool status -v poolname`

This command shows detailed information about pool health, any errors, and %%scrub|scrub%% progress.

<h4>Additional %%ZFS|zfs%% commands</h4>

- To pause a %%scrub|scrub%%: `zpool scrub -p poolname`
- To stop a %%scrub|scrub%%: `zpool scrub -s poolname`
- To list all pools: `zpool list`

:::info

%%ZFS|zfs%% does not require or support traditional `fsck` utilities. The transactional nature of %%ZFS|zfs%% means it moves atomically from one consistent state to another, making scrubbing the preferred method for integrity checking.
