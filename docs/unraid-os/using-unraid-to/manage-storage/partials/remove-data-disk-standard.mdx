This method is ideal for users looking for a simple way to remove a data disk.

1. **Stop the array:** Begin by stopping the array to safely remove the disk.
2. **(Optional) Document your disk assignments:** Consider taking a screenshot of your current disk assignments from the Main tab.
3. **Reset the array configuration:** Use the [Reset the array configuration](#reset-the-array-configuration) procedure. Be sure to choose the option to preserve all current assignments.
4. **Unassign the disk:** Identify and unassign the disk you wish to remove.
5. **Start the array:** After unassigning the disk, start the array again, but do not check the "Parity is valid" box.

Once you start the array, a %%parity|parity%% sync will initiate if you have a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% assigned. Keep in mind that the array will be vulnerable to data loss until this sync completes.

:::tip
Move any important data off the disk before removal. The %%parity|parity%% sync process may take several hours, depending on disk size and system activity.
