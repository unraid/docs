   - Set **Mover action** to **cache → array**.
   - In the **Main** tab, click **Move Now** to run %%Mover|mover%%. Wait for it to finish.
3. **Move files from the %%array|array%% to pool2 (array → cache)**:
   - In the **Shares** tab, set **Primary storage** to pool2 and **Secondary storage** to the %%array|array%% for each share.
   - Set **Mover action** to **array → cache**.
   - In the **Main** tab, click **Move Now** again. Files will move from the %%array|array%% to pool2.
4. **Re-enable Docker and %%VM|vm%% services** (if needed).
