1. Go to **Settings** and turn off Docker and %%VM|vm%% Manager to prevent open files.
2. Move files from pool1 to the %%array|array%% (cache → array):
   - Go to the **Shares** tab. For each share that currently resides on pool1, set **Primary storage** to pool1 and **Secondary storage** to the %%array|array%%.
   - Set **Mover action** to **cache → array**.
   - In the **Main** tab, click **Move Now** to run %%Mover|mover%%. Wait for it to finish.
3. Move files from the %%array|array%% to pool2 (array → cache):
   - In the **Shares** tab, set **Primary storage** to pool2 and **Secondary storage** to the %%array|array%% for each share.
   - Set **Mover action** to **array → cache**.
   - In the **Main** tab, click **Move Now** again. Files will move from the %%array|array%% to pool2.
4. Re-enable Docker and %%VM|vm%% services (if needed).
