**Message:**
`Too many wrong and/or missing disks!`

![Single parity error](/img/Toomanywrong.png)

With **one %%parity drive|parity-drives%%**, you can only have **one** missing disk. With two %%parity drives|parity-drives%%, **two** disks can be missing and you can still start the array, and so on. Parity helps until you can replace the missing disk.

**What to Do:**
Replace the missing disk. For dual-parity configurations, replace the missing disks one at a time.
If you can't recover the data (or if more than 2 disks fail in a dual-parity setup), go to ***Tools â†’ New Config*** to perform the New Config procedure.
