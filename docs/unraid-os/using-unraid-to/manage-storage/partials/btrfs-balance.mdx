The **Balance** operation redistributes data and metadata chunks across your %%BTRFS|btrfs%% pool. This process helps free up space, resolves allocation issues, and can fix “no space left on device” errors even when space seems available.

<h4>When to run Balance</h4>

- When you encounter “no space left on device” errors but have free space.
- After adding or removing drives in a pool.
- To optimize space usage and improve performance.

<h4>How to run Balance</h4>

1. **Access the pool**: In the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, click on the pool in the **Main** tab and select **Balance**.
2. **Add parameters (optional)**: Optionally, add parameters for advanced use (refer to Unraid Help for details).
3. **Start the process**: Click **Start** to begin the process.

:::note[Timing]

Balance operations can take a few minutes to several hours, depending on the pool size and amount of data.
