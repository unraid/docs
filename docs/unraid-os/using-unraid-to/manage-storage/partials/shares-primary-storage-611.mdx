Unraid uses the **%%Mover|mover%%** to manage file placement between the %%cache|cache%% and %%array|array%%, controlled by the **Use Cache for New Files** setting for each share:

- **Yes:** New files go to %%cache|cache%% if space allows; otherwise, to the %%array|array%%. %%Mover|mover%% transfers files from %%cache|cache%% to %%array|array%%.
- **No:** New files go directly to the %%array|array%%. %%Mover|mover%% does nothing for this share.
- **Only:** New files are written only to the %%cache|cache%%. If there’s not enough space, writing fails. %%Mover|mover%% will not move files from %%array|array%% to %%cache|cache%%.
- **Prefer:** New files go to %%cache|cache%% if there’s space; otherwise, to the %%array|array%%. %%Mover|mover%% tries to move files from %%array|array%% back to %%cache|cache%% when possible.

This setting is the default for `appdata` and `system` shares to improve Docker and VM performance.

:::note

Starting with Unraid 6.9, multiple %%pools|cache-pool%% can be created and used as %%cache|cache%%. Any of these %%pools|cache-pool%% can act as a %%cache|cache%%, regardless of their name.
