# Array configuration

Unraid's storage system combines flexibility with data protection through its %%array|array%% and %%cache|cache%% architecture. The %%array|array%% manages your primary storage with optional %%parity|parity%% protection, while cache pools accelerate performance.

Below are some important array configuration principles:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Always use your largest drive(s) for parity.</strong></summary>

  When you add more disks to your %%array|array%% later, remember that you can't use a data disk that's larger than your %%parity disks|parity-drives%%. It's a good idea to buy the biggest hard drive for your %%parity disks|parity-drives%% at the start. This way, you won't be limited by smaller sizes when expanding later.

  If you use two %%parity disks|parity-drives%%, they can be different sizes. However, keep in mind that no disk in your %%array|array%% can be larger than the smallest %%parity disks|parity-drives%% you have.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Do not use SSDs in the array - save them for pools or unassigned devices.</strong></summary>

  Unraid does not support TRIM or Discard operations for SSDs in the main array. Over time, this will cause SSD performance to degrade if they are used as array members. For best results, use SSDs in %%cache pools|cache-pool%% or as unassigned devices, where these features are supported and long-term performance is maintained. Most modern SSDs, including NVMe, work well in these roles.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Using a cache will improve array write performance.</strong></summary>

  Instead of writing directly to the main storage, data is first sent to a dedicated disk or a group of disks. This data is then moved to the main storage at scheduled times, usually once a day at 3:40 AM. The great thing is that data saved to the %%cache|cache%% still appears through your %%user shares|user-share%%, so you don't have to change how you access your files.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Creating a cache pool helps keep your cached data safe.</strong></summary>

  Using only one cache device puts your cached data at risk until it is moved to the main array. To protect your data at all times, use multiple devices configured as a %%cache pool|cache-pool%%. This setup provides redundancy for cached data, reducing the chance of data loss due to a cache device failure.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>SSD cache devices are great for apps and virtual machines.</strong></summary>

  Using SSDs helps applications and virtual machines (VMs) run faster because they can access data more quickly. SSDs work well in a %%cache pool|cache-pool%%, giving you an excellent mix of speed, efficiency, and data security.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Encryption is turned off by default.</strong></summary>

  If you want to use encryption on your system, you must reformat the disk with an encrypted file system type—this process erases all existing data on the drive. Before enabling encryption, move your data off the disk, change the file system to an encrypted option, format the disk, and then move your data back. For details, see [How to encrypt a drive in Unraid](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/securing-your-data.mdx#how-to-encrypt-a-drive-in-unraid).

  Keep in mind that using encryption can make it harder to recover data if something goes wrong, so only use it if you really need it.

</details>

:::info Disk Recognition and Port Flexibility

Unraid identifies disks based on their serial numbers and sizes, not the specific SATA ports they're connected to. This means you can switch drives between different SATA ports without affecting their assignments in Unraid. This feature is particularly useful for troubleshooting hardware problems, like finding a faulty port or replacing unreliable power or SATA cables.

:::

:::caution

Your array will not start if you assign or attach more devices than your license key allows.

:::

## Start/Stop the array

When your system starts up, it usually powers up the array of disks automatically. However, if you've recently changed the disk setup, such as adding a new disk, the array will remain off to allow you to check your configuration.

:::caution

Keep in mind that you'll need to stop the array first to make any adjustments. Stopping it will fully stop all Docker containers and network shares, shut down or hibernate VMs, and your storage devices will be unmounted, making your data and applications inaccessible until you restart the array.

:::

To start or stop the array:

1. Click on the **Main** tab.
2. Navigate to the **Array Operation** section.
3. Click **Start** or **Stop**. You may need to check the box that says "Yes, I want to do this" before proceeding.

---

## Array operations

Unraid provides several maintenance and configuration options for your storage array. Key operations include:

### Adding disks

#### Setting up new disks

1. Go to ***Main → Array Devices*** in the interface.
2. Pick the slot where you want to add the disk and select the disk from the dropdown list.
3. By default, new array drives will be formatted with %%XFS|xfs%%. If you want to use %%ZFS|zfs%% or %%BTRFS|btrfs%% instead, select your preferred file system from the drop-down menu.

:::tip Hot-Swap Feature

If you're using modern Unraid-compatible hardware, you can change disks without shutting down your server. This feature, known as hot-swap, has been available in LimeTech servers since the beginning.

:::

#### Clear vs. Pre-Clear

Unraid requires disks to be in a cleared state - completely filled with zeros and marked with a special signature - before adding them to a parity-protected array. This process ensures parity integrity and keeps the array online during disk preparation.

Clearance is mandatory when adding a data disk to a %%parity|parity%%-protected array. If you are adding a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% or working with an array that does not use %%parity|parity%%, clearance is not required.

The built-in clear operation writes zeros to the disk in the background, allowing the array to remain available. Once the process is complete, the disk must be formatted before use. This method is efficient, requires no third-party tools, and is ideal for quick expansions.

For a more thorough approach, the pre-clear operation – available through plugins like [Unassigned Devices Preclear](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=unassigned+devices#r:~:text=enable%20destructive%20mode.-,Unassigned%20Devices%20Preclear,-dlandon) – performs a pre-read to check for bad sectors, zeros the disk, and then verifies integrity with a post-read. This extra step helps detect early drive failures but takes significantly longer and requires manual plugin installation.

**Rule of thumb:** Use the built-in clear operation for fast additions to your array, or choose pre-clear if you want extensive testing of disk health before putting a drive into service.

<h4>Clear vs. Pre-Clear Comparison</h4>

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  |                  | Clear                       | Pre-Clear                               |
  | ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | **Purpose**      | Ensures basic compatibility | Tests the drive and prepares it for use |
  | **Speed**        | Works quickly               | Much slower process                     |
  | **Array Impact** | Runs in the background      | Needs the disk to be removed from use   |
  | **Best For**     | Ideal for quick expansions  | Great for checking new drives           |
</div>

**Clear** quickly prepares a disk for use, making it compatible with your system and allowing you to add storage in just a few hours.

**Pre-Clear** takes longer but provides a thorough test, ensuring a new disk is reliable before it becomes part of your array.

:::caution Critical Note

Avoid formatting a pre-cleared disk before including it in the array, as this removes the clearance signature.

:::

#### Adding data disks

Adding data disks is a great way to increase your Unraid array's storage space. By adding more disks, you can keep more files, applications, and backups, while still protecting your data.

:::important Important Note:

When adding a new data disk, it must be the same size or smaller than your current %%parity disks|parity-drives%%. If you want to use a larger disk, you'll need to replace the %%parity disks|parity-drives%% first with the larger one, then use the old %%parity disks|parity-drives%% as a data disk.

:::

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to add a data disk</strong></summary>

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="standard" label="Standard addition (Parity-protected)" default>

      To add a data disk to a parity-protected array:

      1. **Stop the array:** Use the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to stop the array.

      2. **Turn off your server:** Power down your server safely.

      3. **Install the new hard drive(s):** Add the new disk(s) physically.

      4. **Power the server back on:** Start your server again.

      5. **Assign the new disk(s):** Use the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to assign the new disks to available data slots.

      6. **Start the array:** Start the array again.

         - Unraid will automatically start a **Clear operation** on the new disk. This fills the disk with zeros and ensures it's ready for use while maintaining data integrity.
         - The clear operation takes place in the background, so you can still access your array. However, the new disk won't be usable until the process is complete and the disk is formatted.
         - If you've pre-cleared the disk, Unraid will skip this step, recognizing that it's already ready to use.

      7. **After Clearing Completes:** Once the clearing process is finished, the disk will show up as unmountable in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. You'll be prompted to format it.

      :::important

      Always double-check the serial number to make sure you're formatting the right disk. Formatting will erase everything on that disk, and this action cannot be undone.

      :::
      8\. **Confirm the Format:** Check the confirmation box and click the **Format** button. Unraid will give you a warning about the outcomes of this action.

      9. **Formatting Process:** The formatting will take a few minutes. Once it's completed, the disk will show as mounted and ready for use. It's normal to see a small amount of used space due to file system overhead.

      :::note

      You can add multiple disks, but they won't be usable until all of them have been cleared and formatted.

      :::

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="no-parity" label="Addition without parity">

      To add a data disk to an array without parity protection:

      1. **Stop the array:** Use the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to stop the array.

#### Adding parity disks

%%Parity disks|parity-drives%% are a helpful feature that provide an extra layer of protection for your data. They allow your storage system to recover information if a hard drive fails. While using %%parity disks|parity-drives%% is optional, it's highly recommended to keep your data safe.

:::important Requirements

- **Single Parity:** The disk must be at least the same size as your largest data drive.
- **Dual Parity:** Both %%parity disks|parity-drives%% must also be at least the size of your largest data drive, but they can be different sizes from each other.

:::

Adding a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% is similar to adding a data disk, but there's one important step to keep in mind:

1. After you select the %%parity disk|parity-drives%% and start your storage array, a process called **parity calculation** begins.
2. While this process runs, you can still access your files. However, the system might run a bit slower because it's working to calculate the parity.

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: What is parity and why does it matter?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  %%Parity|parity%% in Unraid protects your data by ensuring that you can recover from a drive failure. With the use of a %%parity disk|parity-drives%%, any single missing disk can be reconstructed by combining the information from all other data drives along with the %%parity|parity%% data.

  Unraid relies on this real-time parity for two primary purposes:

  - Rebuilding data when a drive fails
  - Correcting errors when a bad sector is found

  This feature allows you to keep your data safe, even as drives will eventually fail over time.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: How does Unraid parity work?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Unraid works with a special bit called the *parity bit*, which is stored for each bit position across all data disks and is managed by a dedicated %%parity disk|parity-drives%%. The %%parity|parity%% is calculated such that the total number of bits in each position across all disks (including the %%parity disk|parity-drives%%) is always an even number, a process known as even parity.

  Here's how it breaks down:

  - Unraid uses the XOR (exclusive OR) operation for this calculation.
  - For example, if you have four drives, and their 57th bits are 1, 1, 1, 1, the parity bit for that position will be 0 (because 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = even).
  - However, if the 57th bits are 1, 0, 0, 0, the %%parity|parity%% for that position will be 1 (to ensure the total remains even).

  When adding a new drive, Unraid first clears it by writing zeros to all bits. This allows for quick inclusion into the protected array since writing zeros does not interfere with the current parity calculations.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: How is data reconstructed using parity?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Unraid can reconstruct a missing drive or repair a bad sector using the following steps:

  - It reads all remaining drives, including the %%parity disk|parity-drives%%.
  - It applies even %%parity|parity%% to solve for the missing data.

  For example, if drive 2 fails:

  - If the related bits are 1, 1, 1 (in addition to the %%parity|parity%%), Unraid calculates: 1 + x + 1 + 1 + 0 = even. Here, x must be 1 to maintain an even total.
  - If the bits show 1, x, 0, 0, 1 = even, then x will equal 0.

  This %%parity|parity%% feature allows Unraid to "simulate" the missing disk. You can continue using the array as if the drive were still functional. Once you install a new drive in the failed slot, Unraid will recreate all the missing data based on the current state of %%parity|parity%% and the other disks.

  To ensure ongoing protection and effective recovery, it's important to run regular %%parity checks|parity-check%%.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How big does my parity disk need to be?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Your %%parity disk|parity-drives%% must be **equal to or larger than your largest data disk**. For instance:

  - If your largest data disk is 10TB, your %%parity disk|parity-drives%% should be at least 10TB.
  - You can use various other data disk sizes freely, as long as none exceeds the size of the %%parity disk|parity-drives%%.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: How does parity affect write performance?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Writing to a %%parity|parity%%-protected array involves four disk operations for each write: reading data, reading %%parity|parity%%, writing data, and writing %%parity|parity%%. This process requires a full rotation from each affected drive, so the overall write speed is limited by the slowest drive involved in the operation.

  Adding a faster %%parity disk|parity-drives%% won't necessarily improve write speeds unless you're writing to multiple slow data disks simultaneously, allowing the %%parity disk|parity-drives%% to handle the load. Typically, the write speed is constrained by the slowest data drive being written to.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-depth: How does Dual Parity work?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Dual %%parity|parity%% enables recovery from **two simultaneous disk failures**. In Unraid, the second %%parity disk|parity-drives%% doesn't simply mirror the first. Instead:

  - **Parity 1:** Employs standard XOR (even) %%parity|parity%% calculations.
  - **Parity 2:** Utilizes a more complex algorithm (Galois field, rather than Reed-Solomon as in traditional %%RAID 6|raid6%%), allowing Unraid to rebuild from any two missing disks at the same time. This feature is significant for larger arrays, where the risk of multiple failures increases. Dual %%parity|parity%% significantly boosts resilience without the added overhead of mirrored redundancy.

</details>

:::caution Remember

When setting up a new data storage system, add your data disks **first**, making sure they all use a compatible file system. **After** placing your data disks, you can add a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% to protect against drive failures.

Once your %%parity disk|parity-drives%% is added, remember that any new disk you want to include in the array must be cleared (zeroed) before it's integrated. This is to ensure that the %%parity|parity%% remains valid and continues to protect your data.

:::

#### Upgrading parity disks

You can upgrade your %%parity disk|parity-drives%% device(s) to a larger one(s) to use larger-sized disks in the array or add an additional %%parity disk|parity-drives%%.

:::caution

If you're planning to take the following steps and only have one %%parity disk|parity-drives%%, keep these points in mind:

- Your data will be unprotected until the %%parity|parity%% rebuild is complete. If a data drive fails during this time, you could lose the information on that drive.
- If you already have a data drive that has failed, proceeding with these steps will prevent you from being able to rebuild that drive. In this case, you should follow the **Parity Swap** procedure instead.

:::

To remove a parity drive:

1. **Stop the array:** Use the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to stop the array.

:::tip

If your server supports hot-swap, you do not need to power down to change disks. You can safely skip steps 2 and 4.

:::
2\. **Power down the server:** Turn off your server to safely make hardware changes.
3\. **Install the new %%parity disk|parity-drives%%:** Place the new, larger %%parity disk|parity-drives%% into your server.
4\. **Power up the server:** Turn the server back on.
5\. **Assign the new disk:** Go to the parity slot in your settings and assign the new disk, replacing the old one.
6\. **Start the array:** Use the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% to start the array again.

Once the array is back up, Unraid will start building %%parity|parity%% on the new disk. You can still access your data during this time, but keep in mind that it might be a bit slower until the process is done. Once the %%parity|parity%% build is complete, your data is protected again!

:::important Important Tips

- **Keep the old disk:** Don't remove the old %%parity disk|parity-drives%% until the new %%parity|parity%% build finishes. If a data disk fails during the upgrade, having the old disk might help you recover your data.

- **Dual parity users:** If you have two %%parity disks|parity-drives%%, upgrade one at a time for added safety.

- **Repurpose the old disk:** After the upgrade, you can use the old %%parity disk|parity-drives%% as a data disk if it still meets your storage needs.

:::

### Replacing disks

You may need to replace disks in your array for two main reasons:

1. [**Capacity upgrade**](#upgrading-capacity): Your storage is nearly full, and you want to use larger disks.
2. [**Failure or retirement**](#replacing-faileddisabled-disks): A disk has failed or is no longer supported.

While the process for replacing disks is similar in both cases, be cautious, as there is a risk of data loss during the replacement. Parity devices help protect your data; one parity device can safeguard against a single disk failure, while two can protect against losing data if two disks fail. Always be aware of your protection level during disk replacements.

#### Upgrading capacity

When upgrading your data drive to a larger one, here are some points to keep in mind:

- **Unmountable disks:** Fix any unmountable disks before upgrading. An unmountable status won't be resolved during the rebuild.

- **Single parity risks:** If you have single parity, you're at risk of data loss if another drive fails during the upgrade. Seek advice in forums if this happens.

- **Dual parity protection:** With dual parity, you're safe from losing data if one drive fails while upgrading a single drive. You can also upgrade two drives at once, but note that this increases the risk since you won't have protection against another drive failing.

- **Backup the old disk:** Keep the original disk intact until the upgrade is confirmed successful. This provides a fallback option if anything goes wrong.

:::caution Warning

Replacing drives always involves some risk. If another drive fails during the upgrade, especially with only single parity, you may experience data loss. Always check the health of your drives before beginning the process, and ensure that you keep the old drive intact until the upgrade is complete and your data is confirmed to be safe.

:::

To upgrade an existing data disk:

1. **Run a parity check:** First, ensure the integrity of your data by running a %%parity check|parity-check%%. Go to [***Tools → Parity Check***](#checking-array-devices) and make sure there are **zero errors**. If parity isn't valid, rebuilding the disk will corrupt its file system.

2. **Stop the array:** Next, you'll want to stop the array. Navigate to ***Main → Array Operation*** and select **Stop**.

3. **Unassign the target disk:** Once the array is stopped, find the disk you want to replace. Remove it from its slot in ***Main → Array Devices***.

4. **Start the array:** Now, start the array again. Unraid will emulate the missing disk using the existing parity and data disks. You have two modes to choose from:
   - **%%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%%:** This mode prevents any writes to the %%emulated disk|emulated-disk%%.
   - **Normal Mode:** If you need read/write access to the %%emulated disk|emulated-disk%%, select this option.

:::note

Starting the array in Normal Mode at this point is optional. You can use it to verify that the emulated disk mounts and the data looks correct before proceeding, but it is not required for the upgrade process.

:::

5. **Stop the array again:** The array should now show that the unassigned disk has failed. Stop the array once more.

6. **Assign the replacement disk:** Insert your new, larger disk into the vacant slot in the array.

7. **Start the array to rebuild:** Finally, start the array again. Unraid will now rebuild the contents of the %%emulated disk|emulated-disk%% onto the new disk. The file system will automatically adjust to take full advantage of the larger disk's capacity.

#### Replacing failed/disabled disks

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is a failed/disabled disk?</strong></summary>

  A failed or disabled disk is one that Unraid has stopped using for writing data, usually because it encountered a write error. Keep in mind these don't always mean the drive itself is broken; sometimes, it might be due to bad connections, power issues, or just a temporary glitch.

  Some indications include:

  <div class="text--center">
    ![Red "X" indicates write error](/img/Diskfailureindicator.png)
    <p class="caption-center">*This red "X" shows which disk needs replacement.*</p>
  </div>

  <br />

  <div class="text--center">
    ![Failure notification alert](/img/Diskfailurenotification.png)
    <p class="caption-center">*Keep an eye out for these alerts.*</p>
  </div>

  <br />

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Click to see how different parity configurations handle disk failures</strong></summary>

    | Failure Scenario    | No Parity | Single Parity | Dual Parity |
    | ------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
    | **1 Disk Failure**  | Data Lost | Rebuildable   | Rebuildable |
    | **2 Disk Failures** | Data Lost | Data Lost     | Rebuildable |

    :::tip Tips for Safe Rebuilds

    - **For Single Parity:** You can only replace one disk at a time. If another disk fails during the rebuild, you could lose data.
    - **For Dual Parity:** You can replace one or two disks at the same time, but be cautious if more than two disks fail.

    :::

    :::important

    If you experience a situation where **more disks fail than your parity can protect:**

    1. **Immediately halt all write operations** to prevent further data loss.
    2. Seek help by posting your issue in the [Unraid forums](https://forums.unraid.net/) along with diagnostics.
    3. **Do not attempt a rebuild** until you've received advice - focus on salvaging your data first.

    :::

  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to diagnose the issue</strong></summary>

  To diagnose the issue, start by checking the %%syslog|syslog%% and %%SMART reports|smart-report%%:

  - If the %%syslog|syslog%% shows that the drive has reset, there might be a problem with the connection or cables.
  - %%SMART reports|smart-report%% can help assess the drive's health, but the best way to check is by running a %%SMART|smart%% extended test. If it completes without errors, the drive is likely fine.
  - If you see %%CRC errors|crc-errors%%, it usually points to issues with the cabling. Keep an eye on these errors, as they accumulate over time and don't reset.

  :::tip

  To stay informed about drive issues, [enable notifications](../../getting-started/set-up-unraid/customize-unraid-settings.mdx#notification-settings) in Unraid. This way, you are alerted right away if something goes wrong, reducing the risk to your data.

  :::

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is emulation?</strong></summary>

  When a drive is disabled, Unraid will use its parity and other working drives to emulate the failed drive. This means your system continues to operate, and you can still access the data stored on the %%emulated drive|emulated-disk%%:

  - Unraid will stop writing to the physical drive, and any updates will be saved in parity and the emulation instead.
  - Before replacing the failed drive, you can check and recover data from the %%emulated drive|emulated-disk%%, which keeps the physical drive intact for potential recovery.
  - If you can't access the %%emulated drive|emulated-disk%%, repairing the file system is essential before any rebuild since fixing the file system is quicker and more effective than a rebuild.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Preparing for drive replacement</strong></summary>

  When you need to replace a drive, make sure the new drive is at least as large as the failed drive but not larger than your smallest parity drive. If you have to use a larger drive, follow the **Parity Swap** procedure.

  While it's not mandatory, many users choose to pre-clear new drives to test them and help prevent early failure. You can do this with the Preclear plugin, a %%SMART|smart%% extended test, or manufacturer tools.

  :::caution

  If you try to rebuild using an unmountable %%emulated drive|emulated-disk%%, the new drive will also become unmountable. Always repair the file system before attempting a rebuild.

  :::

</details>

If a disk in your Unraid system has failed or is disabled, don't worry! You can replace it and recover your data. Just follow these simple steps. Remember, you need a new disk that is the same size or larger than the one you're replacing, but it can't be larger than your smallest %%parity disk|parity-drives%%.

:::important

Before you start, make sure to check for any disk errors or warnings. Unraid must be able to read all the remaining disks without any issues for the rebuild to work correctly. If another disk is failing, it could lead to data loss.

:::

To replace and rebuild a disk:

1. **Stop the array:**

   - Log in to the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%% (the web interface).
   - Find the option to stop the array. This is necessary before you can change any disks.

:::tip

If your server supports hot-swap, you can skip the next step and just stop the array.

:::

2. **Power down your server** (only if **not** using hot-swap):
   - If your server doesn't support hot-swap, you'll need to shut it down completely.

3. **Replace the failed disk:**
   - Remove the old, failed disk from your server.
   - Insert the new disk. Just remember, it has to be at least the same size as the old disk but no bigger than your smallest %%parity disk|parity-drives%%.

4. **Power up the server** (if you powered it down):
   - Turn your server back on if you shut it down.

5. **Assign the new disk:**
   - Go back to the Unraid %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
   - Find the slot for the failed disk and assign your new disk to that slot.

6. **Confirm your action:**
   - You'll see a confirmation box. Check the box that says **Yes, I want to do this** and confirm.

7. **(Optional) Choose %%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%%:**
   - You can select %%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%%, which can make the rebuild process faster. However, during this time, you won't be able to access the array at all.
   - If you choose %%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%%, make sure to click **Sync** to start the rebuild.

8. **Start the rebuild:**
   - Click **Start** to begin the process. Unraid will copy your data from the %%emulated disk|emulated-disk%% to the new disk.
   - If your new disk is larger, Unraid will manage the extra space for you.

:::warning

If Unraid prompts you to format the new disk during the rebuild, **do not do it**. Formatting will wipe all data and make recovery impossible.

:::

<h4>What to expect during the rebuild</h4>

- The array will still be available to use during the rebuilding process (unless you're in %%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%%), but it might run slower.
- Rebuilding can take several hours, depending on your disk sizes and system usage.
- The new disk will have the same file system as the original.
- If the old disk was unmountable due to file system issues, the new disk will also not be mountable. Please fix any file system issues before starting the rebuild.

:::note Additional notes

- The rebuild process won't change the file format of the disk; it simply restores its previous form.
- Always check the health of every disk before you start a rebuild to avoid any potential issues.

#### Parity swap

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="what" label="What is parity swap?">

    A %%parity swap|parity-swap%% is a special procedure in Unraid used when you need to replace a data disk with a disk that is larger than your current parity disk. The process moves your current parity disk to the data slot, then installs a new, larger disk as the new parity disk. This ensures your array remains protected and allows for larger data drives in the future.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="when" label="When to use parity swap?">

    Use a %%parity swap|parity-swap%% when your replacement data drive is larger than your current parity disk. This is not necessary if your new data drive is the same size or smaller than your parity disk.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Example scenario</strong></summary>

  You have an Unraid setup with a **2TB parity drive** and a **1TB data drive** and want to replace the 1TB drive with a **4TB drive**.

  First, assign the new 4TB drive as the parity drive, which will replace the 2TB drive. Then move the original 2TB drive to the data slot, and remove the 1TB drive entirely.

  After these changes, you'll have a 4TB drive as your new parity, ensuring you can add future data drives up to 4TB. The 2TB drive will now hold your existing data, while the 1TB drive can be repurposed.

  This swap keeps your data secure and your array protected, allowing for future upgrades.

</details>

:::important Prerequisites

- Before starting, ensure the data drive you want to replace is disabled. If the drive has failed (shows a red indicator), it is already disabled. If the drive is healthy but you want to replace it, unassign the drive and start the array once without it to force Unraid to mark it as disabled.
- If your replacement data drive is not larger than your parity drive, use the standard [Replacing a Data Drive](#replacing-faileddisabled-disks) procedure instead.
- This procedure is only needed for replacing data drives in an Unraid array with a disk larger than the current parity drive. If you only need to upgrade your parity drive, simply remove the old parity drive, add the new one, and start the array. Parity will rebuild automatically.

:::

:::warning Warnings

- Always verify the health of all drives using %%SMART reports|smart-report%% before starting a %%parity swap|parity-swap%. Attempting this procedure with another failing or unhealthy disk increases the risk of data loss.
- Preclear the new disk if possible. While not required, preclearing stress-tests the drive and reduces the risk of early failure.
- Correctly identify all drives before beginning. Note the model numbers and last four characters of each serial number to avoid mistakes during assignment.

:::

To carry out a parity swap:
:::note

If the drive to be replaced is already disabled (failed), you may not need to perform steps 1–4. If you have already installed the new replacement drive (for example, after preclearing), you can skip steps 5–8.

:::

1. **Stop the array** if it is running.
2. **Unassign the old data drive** if it is still assigned. If the drive was previously healthy, you may see error notifications for a missing drive - this is expected.
3. **Start the array.** If prompted, check the box confirming your action. The data drive should now show as "Not installed."
4. **Stop the array again.** At this point, the array treats the drive as failed.
5. **Power down the server.**
   :::tip

   If your system supports **hot-swap**, you do not need to power down to remove or install disks. Just make sure the array is stopped before making any hardware changes.

:::
6\. *(Optional)* **Remove the old drive.** You may wish to keep it installed for testing or reassignment.
7\. **Install the new drive.** Pre-clearing is strongly recommended, but formatting is not needed.
8\. **Power on the server.**
9\. **Stop the array** if it started automatically. If you see a message about retrying to unmount disk shares, disable Docker and/or VM services in Settings, reboot, and try again.
10\. **Unassign the parity drive.**
11\. **Assign the new drive to the parity slot.** You may receive error notifications - this is normal.
12\. **Assign the old %%parity drive|parity-drives%% to the data slot** of the drive being replaced. Both the parity and replacement data drives should now display blue status indicators.
13\. **Go to *Main → Array Operation.*** You should see a **Copy** button and a message stating "Copy will copy the parity information to the new %%parity disk|parity-drives%%."
14\. **Confirm and start the copy process.** Check the confirmation box and click **Copy**. The array will not be available during this operation.

- The copy process can take many hours, depending on disk size. When finished, the array will be stopped and ready for a data rebuild.

15. **Start the array to begin the data rebuild.**
    - Confirm your action if prompted. The array is now started, and data is reconstructed onto the new data drive.
    - You can use the array during the rebuild, but for best performance, limit usage.
    - The rebuild process will also take several hours.

:::warning

Never format a drive during this process. Formatting will erase all data and update parity, making recovery impossible.

:::

After completion, you will have a larger parity disk and a replaced data disk. Many users run a %%parity check|parity-check%% afterward for extra confidence, though this is optional.

---

### Removing disks

There may come a time when you want to remove a disk from your Unraid array. Whether you're looking to save on power, retire an old or unreliable drive, or repurpose hardware for a different use, the process is fairly straightforward.

#### Removing parity disks

If you find that you no longer need the level of %%parity|parity%% protection in your setup, you can remove a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% whenever you want.

To remove a %%parity drives|parity-drives%%:

1. **Stop the array:** Begin by accessing the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% and stopping the array.
2. **Unassign the %%parity drives|parity-drives%%:** Locate the %%parity drives|parity-drives%% slot and set it to "Unassigned."
3. **Start the array:** Finally, restart the array to commit the changes and successfully remove the %%parity drives|parity-drives%% from the configuration.

:::warning

Before you make any changes, please keep this in mind: If you already have any failed data drives in your array, removing a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% can decrease the number of failures Unraid can handle without risking data loss.

- With dual parity, you can recover from a single failed drive, but be aware that you won't be able to survive another failure during the rebuild process.
- With single parity, you lose all redundancy, meaning that any additional drive failures could result in data loss.

:::

#### Removing data disks

Removing a data disk is a straightforward process, but it's important to remember that you'll need to perform a %%parity|parity%% sync afterwards. Until this sync is complete, there's a risk of data loss if another disk fails.

You can choose from two methods to remove a data disk:

1. **Standard method** - Recommended for most users.
2. **Parity-preserve method** - Suitable for advanced users who want to maintain parity during the removal.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="standard" label="Standard method" default>

    This method is ideal for users looking for a simple way to remove a data disk.

    1. **Stop the array:**  Begin by stopping the array to safely remove the disk.
    2. **(Optional) Document Your disk assignments:** For your reference, you may want to take a screenshot of your current disk assignments from the Main tab.
    3. **Reset the array configuration:** Use the [Reset the array configuration](#reset-the-array-configuration) procedure. Be sure to choose the option to preserve all current assignments.
    4. **Unassign the disk:** Identify and unassign the disk you wish to remove.
    5. **Start the array:** After unassigning the disk, start the array again, but do not check the "Parity is valid" box.

    Once you start the array, a %%parity|parity%% sync will initiate if you have a %%parity disk|parity-drives%% assigned. Keep in mind that the array will be vulnerable to data loss until this sync completes.

    :::tip

    Move any important data off the disk before removal. The %%parity|parity%% sync process may take several hours, depending on disk size and system activity.

    :::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="parity-preserve" label="Parity-preserve method (Advanced)">

    The parity-preserve method allows you to remove a data disk from your Unraid array without losing your parity protection. This process requires careful preparation and some technical knowledge and is only recommended for Advanced users.

    <h4>What this method does</h4>

    This method effectively zeros out the data disk you want to remove, allowing you to keep your parity intact. Since a disk filled with zeroes does not affect parity, your array remains protected throughout the procedure.

    <h4>When to use this method</h4>

    Use the %%parity|parity%%-preserve method to remove a data disk while keeping your %%parity|parity%% valid safely. This is especially useful to avoid a full %%parity|parity%% sync after removal. Please ensure that the disk you're removing is healthy.

    :::important Prerequisites

    Before you begin, ensure that you meet the following conditions:

    - The disk you want to remove must be healthy and mounted.
    - This method allows you to remove only one disk at a time.
    - Note that there is no official support from LimeTech for this process; please proceed with caution.

    :::

    :::warning

    This method will erase all data on the selected disk. Please verify that all files, including hidden files, are removed before proceeding.

    :::
    To remove a disk using the parity-preserve method:

    1. **Remove disk from shares:** Ensure the disk is excluded from all shares, including global share settings.
    2. **Start the array:** Start the array with the disk assigned and mounted.
    3. **Record array assignments:** Note your array assignments, especially the %%parity drive|parity-drives%%, as a safety measure.
    4. **(Optional) Enable Turbo Write:** For faster zeroing, enable Reconstruct Write ("Turbo Write") in **Settings → Disk Settings**, but only if all drives are healthy.
    5. **Zero out the disk:** Use the alternative command-line method below to manually zero out the disk.
    6. **Stop the array:** Once the clearing is complete, stop the array.
    7. **Reset array configuration:** Retain all current assignments when resetting the array configuration.
    8. **Unassign the disk:** Unassign the disk you wish to remove, double-checking all assignments, especially the %%parity drive|parity-drives%%.
    9. **Confirm parity status:** Check the box indicating "Parity is already valid."
    10. **Start the array again:** Start the array to finish the removal process.
    11. **(Optional) Verify parity:** You can run a correcting %%parity check|parity-check%% afterward to ensure parity integrity.

    <details>
      <summary>**Alternative command-line method for zeroing a disk**</summary>

      If you're comfortable using the Linux command line, you can manually zero out your disk using the following instructions. Be sure to choose the command that corresponds with your version of Unraid.

      Since zeroing a disk can take many hours, it's recommended to use something like the [Tmux Terminal Manager TTM plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/183427-plugin-tmux-terminal-manager-ttm/) to type the commands and make sure the session remains up.

      **For Unraid 6.12 or later:**

      1. First, unmount the disk:
         ```bash
         umount /mnt/diskX
         ```

      2. With newer releases we need to mount a dummy fs image in place of the disk that we unmounted, or the array won't stop in the end:

         ```bash
         truncate -s 400M /tmp/xmini.img
         mkfs.xfs -f /tmp/xmini.img > /dev/null
         mount /tmp/xmini.img /mnt/diskX  
         ```

      3. Zero out the disk with the following command:
         ```bash
         dd bs=1M if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mdXp1 bs=4K status=progress
         ```

      **For Unraid 6.11 and earlier:**

      1. Start by unmounting the disk:
         ```bash
         umount /mnt/diskX
         ```
      2. Next, use this command to zero out the disk:
         ```bash
         dd bs=1M if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mdX bs=4K status=progress
         ```

      :::note

      Remember to replace `X` with the specific number of the data disk you are removing.

      :::

      :::caution

      Before executing these commands, double-check the drive number to avoid accidentally erasing data on the wrong disk.

### Checking array devices

Regularly checking your Unraid array is crucial for maintaining data integrity and identifying potential issues before they result in data loss. You can initiate a check using the **Check** button under ***Array Operations***. Depending on your array's configuration, this button allows you to conduct either a %%parity check|parity-check%% or a %%read check|read-check%%.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '400px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![The check button lets you perform parity and read checks](/img/Check_button.PNG)
</div>

For convenience, you can schedule these checks to run automatically at intervals that suit you by navigating to ***Settings → Scheduler***. It's advisable to perform automated, non-correcting checks on a monthly or quarterly basis to ensure the ongoing health of your data.

#### Parity & Read checks

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="parity-check" label="Parity checks" default>

    A %%parity check|parity-check%% is essential when your array includes at least one assigned parity device. During this process, all data disks are read simultaneously. The system recalculates the parity and compares it to the information stored on your %%parity disk(s)|parity-drives%%.

    <details>
      <summary><strong>In-depth: Parity sync vs. Parity check - What's the difference?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

      A %%parity|parity%% sync reads all data disks and creates %%parity|parity%% from scratch, saving the results on the %%parity drives|parity-drives%%. This process typically happens when you add or replace a %%parity drives|parity-drives%% or after significant configuration changes.

      A %%parity check|parity-check%% reads all data disks along with the %%parity drives|parity-drives%%. It recalculates the %%parity|parity%% values and compares them to the stored values. There are two modes for running a %%parity check|parity-check%%:

      - **Correcting (CORRECT):** If it finds a mismatch, it updates the %%parity disk|parity-drives%% and logs the event.
      - **Non-correcting (NOCORRECT):** Only logs any errors found without updating the parity.

      To avoid excessive logging, only the first 100 addresses with errors are reported during a %%parity check|parity-check%%. These mismatches are referred to as **sync errors** and indicate where the parity does not align with the data, typically due to issues such as sudden power losses or hardware problems. Each sync error is counted in 4KiB blocks - this is the system's I/O unit size (known as the Linux page size).

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>In-depth: What does "valid" mean for parity and array disks?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

      A **valid %%parity disk|parity-drives%%** indicates that after the last successful %%parity|parity%% sync, Unraid recognized the %%parity|parity%% as "good," meaning it's suitable for data recovery if a disk fails. The "valid" status applies to every disk in the array, not just the %%parity|parity%% one. If all disks except one are valid, Unraid can reconstruct the missing or failed disk's data using %%parity|parity%%.

      Unraid maintains the %%parity disk|parity-drives%%'s "valid" status even when some sync errors occur following a non-correcting check. This ensures that you can still recover a failed disk. If the %%parity|parity%% were marked as invalid, you would risk having two invalid disks after just one additional failure, leading to potential data loss.

    </details>

    While a %%parity check|parity-check%% is in progress, you can still use the array. However, be aware that performance may slow down due to drive contention, as both file operations and the check will compete for resources.

    Normally, if the %%parity check|parity-check%% identifies errors, Unraid will update the %%parity disk|parity-drives%% to align with the computed data and increment the Sync Errors counter.

    :::tip

    If you prefer to run a check without making corrections, simply uncheck **Write corrections to parity** before starting. This way, errors will be reported but not fixed.

    :::

    :::important

    A correcting %%parity check|parity-check%% is automatically initiated after an "Unsafe Shutdown" - this occurs when the array is restarted without being properly stopped. The most frequent cause of such an event is unexpected power loss, which can leave write operations incomplete. Using an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is highly recommended to avoid this scenario. This measure helps maintain the integrity of your data and prevents potential issues.

    :::
    <h4>What are parity errors?</h4>

    %%Parity|parity%% errors happen when the %%parity|parity%% information your system calculates doesn't match what's stored on your %%parity drives|parity-drives%%. This mismatch can arise from several issues, including:

    - Sudden power loss or unsafe shutdowns
    - Failing drives or disk errors
    - Problems with cables or connections
    - Unclean shutdowns or unexpected system crashes

    When %%parity|parity%% errors occur, either the %%parity drives|parity-drives%% or the data disks could be out of sync. Ideally, a %%parity check|parity-check%% should report zero errors so everything functions correctly.

    <h4>What to do if you encounter %%parity|parity%% errors</h4>

    If your %%parity check|parity-check%% reveals errors:

    1. **Investigate the problem:** Start by checking %%SMART reports|smart-report%%, which provide detailed information about your drives' health. Look for any signs of disk or connection problems.

    2. **Seek help from our forums:** If you cannot resolve the issue on your own, consider reaching out for advice on the Unraid forums. The community can offer valuable insights and suggestions based on their experiences.

    3. **Run another check:** After you've addressed any hardware issues, running another %%parity check|parity-check%% is a good idea to ensure everything is back in order.

    :::info Rebuild Time

    Remember that %%parity checks|parity-check%% can take several hours, depending on the size of your disks and the activity level of your system. For the best results, schedule these checks during times of low system usage.

    :::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="read-check" label="Read checks">

    A %%read check|read-check%% is an important task you should perform under certain conditions to ensure the health of your storage array. This check is necessary **if your array does not have any parity devices assigned** or **if you have more disabled drives than available parity drives**.

    During a %%read check|read-check%%, every sector of every disk in the array is examined. The goal is to verify that all data can be accessed and to identify any unrecoverable read errors.

    <div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '650px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      ![History lets you review stats on your read check operations](/img/History_button.PNG)
    </div>

    <h4>Why read checks matter</h4>

    Read checks are essential for monitoring the health of your disks, especially in configurations without parity protection. If a disk encounters an unrecoverable read error during the check, the affected data cannot be retrieved, which could lead to data loss. Therefore, keeping an eye on the results of these checks is crucial, and taking action when errors are reported is necessary.

    You can also review the history of %%read check|read-check%% operations in the Unraid interface, which helps you spot trends or recurring issues over time.

    <h4>When to use a read check</h4>

    Consider running a %%read check|read-check%% in the following situations:

    - **No parity devices assigned:** When your array lacks parity protection.
    - **Verifying disk integrity:** To confirm the integrity of each disk without making any corrections.
    - **Post-hardware issue resolution:** After fixing hardware issues, to ensure all disks are healthy.

    <h4>What to do if errors are found</h4>

    If your %%read check|read-check%% reports errors, here are some steps to follow:

    1. **Review SMART reports:** Check the %%SMART reports|smart-report%% for the affected disks to understand their health status.
    2. **Inspect connections:** Ensure that physical connections and cables are secure.
    3. **Consider replacements:** If a disk shows persistent errors, think about replacing it.
    4. **Backup critical data:** Move important data off any disks reporting errors as soon as possible to prevent data loss.

    :::warning

    Without parity protection, any unrecoverable read error will lead to permanent data loss for the affected files or sectors.

    :::

    :::tip

    To maintain the health of your disks, it's wise to **schedule regular %%read checks|read-check%%**, especially if your array does not have parity protection. This proactive measure will help you catch potential issues early and safeguard your data.

    :::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Check history

Whenever the system performs a %%parity check|parity-check%% or a %%read check|read-check%%, it keeps a record of what happened. You can view these details easily by clicking the **History** button found under ***Array Operations*** in the interface.

For those who want to dive deeper, all these records are saved in a text file located in the `config` directory on your Unraid USB flash device.

---

### Spinning disks down or up

Unraid allows you to control the power states of your hard drives. You can easily %%spin them up or down|spin-state%%, and manage SSDs to be active or in standby. This helps save energy, extend the life of your drives, and reduce noise when the disks are not being used.

<h4>Why spin down or up?</h4>

- **Spin down:** If you have drives that aren't used often, spinning them down can save energy and help them last longer.
- **Spin up:** If you know you'll need files soon, spinning up the disks ahead of time can cut down wait times.

<h4>How to control spin states</h4>

You can control disk spin states through the **Main** tab in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%:

1. **Go to the Main tab** and locate your array devices
2. **Find the spin control buttons** - each disk will show either:
   - Click the 🔘 button to **Spin Up** if the disk is currently spun down
   - Click the 🟢 button to **Spin Down** if the disk is currently spinning
3. **Click the appropriate button** for the action you want:
   - Click **Spin Down** 🟢 to power down an idle disk and save energy
   - Click **Spin Up** 🔘 to power up a disk that's currently spun down

Remember that if a disk is being accessed (like if you're opening a file), it will stay active and ignore any spin-down request.

When a disk is spun down, its temperature won't show in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. However, once any application or user accesses it, it will automatically spin up.

:::tip

Use the spin controls to save power and reduce wear on your drives. Remember that disks that are actively being used will stay on until all tasks are finished.

:::

---

### Reset the array configuration

Resetting your array configuration is an important step that should be undertaken carefully. This process is usually necessary when removing a disk, starting fresh with a new array layout, or fixing disk assignment issues. Please note that this action can impact data protection and parity, so ensure you only proceed when truly needed.

Common reasons to reset your array include:

- **Removing or replacing disks:** If you need to take out or swap out any disks in your array.
- **Starting anew:** When you're looking to create a brand new layout for your array.
- **Fixing disk assignment errors:** To correct any issues with how disks are currently assigned.
- **Recovering from configuration problems:** When facing challenges with your existing setup.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '650px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![Resetting your disk configuration can be done via the new config page](/img/Newconfig.png)
</div>

To reset your array configuration:

1. Go to the **Tools** page and click on **New Config**.
2. You can keep some existing disk assignments if you only wish to make minor adjustments. This can save time and minimize the chance of errors.
3. Confirm your choice by checking the box, then click **Apply**.
4. Head back to the **Main** tab. After applying the changes, your configuration will have been reset.
5. Make any necessary changes to your configuration by assigning or unassigning disks as appropriate.
6. Launch the array in Normal or %%Maintenance Mode|maintenance-mode%% to finalize your updates.

:::important

- **Data preservation:** Unraid will attempt to recognize previously used drives and preserve data where possible.
- **Impact on parity:** Removing a data drive will always invalidate parity unless that drive was zeroed before removal.
- **Disk reordering:** Changing the order of disks won't affect parity1, but it *can* invalidate parity2.

:::

:::caution

When you see the **Start** button, there is a checkbox labeled **Parity is Valid**. Only check this box if you are certain it is correct or if an experienced Unraid user has advised you to do so during recovery. Incorrectly checking this option can lead to data loss.

Do not use **New Config** if your goal is to rebuild a disk. Performing a New Config clears the array history required for a rebuild, and Unraid will not offer to rebuild the disk afterward. Follow the disk rebuild procedure instead.
::::

#### Undoing a reset

If you find that you need to reverse a reset:

1. Access your flash device over the network (SMB).
2. Locate and open the `config` folder.
3. Rename the file `super.old` to `super.dat`.
4. Reboot your server, and your prior array configuration should be restored.

---

### Status reports

Unraid provides status reports that help you keep track of the health of your storage array. These reports are a quick way to check if any of your disks are disabled or having issues with reading or writing data.

- **Current status:** Status reports show the current condition of your array. It's important to note that this information resets after you restart your system, so that it won't keep a history of past issues.

- **No historical data:** If you want to see what has happened before a reboot, you'll need to look elsewhere, as these reports don't save past states.

:::important

Remember that the status reports don't include %%SMART|smart%% data. %%SMART reports|smart-report%% give you a more detailed view of individual disk health. So, even if your status report shows everything is fine, checking the %%SMART reports|smart-report%% regularly is still a good idea to catch any potential problems early.

:::

---

## Array write modes

Unraid provides various write modes for managing array operations, each with its own pros and cons regarding speed, power consumption, and drive wear. Knowing how these modes work, along with the role of a cache drive or pool, can help you fine-tune your server to best suit your needs.

**Write modes at a glance**

| Write Mode                | Speed (Typical)                          | Power usage | When drives spin up          | Data protection  | Best use case                                                         |

<h3>Read/Modify/Write</h3>

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  <h4>How it works</h4>
  This mode reads the existing data and the parity, calculates the new parity, and then writes the updated data. Only the %%parity drive|parity-drives%% and the target data drive spin up, which results in lower power usage and less wear on the drives. However, it can be slower due to the additional read/write cycles.

  <h4>When to use</h4>

  - Anytime, especially if you want energy savings and idle drives to spin down.
  - Great for small or infrequent writes.

</details>

<h3>Turbo Write (Reconstruct write)</h3>

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  Turbo write, also known as reconstruct write, is a feature designed to boost the writing speed of your Unraid array. It works by reading all data drives and updating the parity simultaneously. This process eliminates the delays caused by waiting for the platters to rotate, as seen in the default write mode. However, it's important to note that all array drives need to be spinning and functioning properly for this to work effectively.

  <h4>How it works</h4>

  - When you write new data, Unraid reads from all the other data drives and recalculates the parity at the same time. Both the new data and the updated parity get written together.
  - All drives in the array must be operational and actively spinning.
  - This method significantly enhances write speeds compared to the default writing mode.

  <h4>When to use Turbo Write</h4>

  - Utilize turbo write when transferring large, sequential files to the array.
  - It's effective during array rebuilds or %%parity checks|parity-check%%, as all drives will already be spinning.
  - This mode is very useful when minimizing write time is a priority and you can confirm all drives are healthy.

  <h4>When to avoid Turbo Write</h4>

  - Avoid using this mode if you want your drives to spin down during idle times to conserve energy.
  - Turbo write isn't ideal for small or infrequent write operations since it causes all drives to spin up for every write, increasing power usage and wear on the drives.
  - If you suspect that any drive is failing or is unreliable, it's best to steer clear of turbo write since it relies on every drive being operational.

  :::info

  Turbo write is best suited for bulk operations and scenarios requiring high throughput. However, it might not be the best choice for everyday tasks if you're focused on energy savings and minimizing drive wear.

<h3>Cache Write</h3>

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  <h4>How it works</h4>

  Data is written first to a fast SSD or NVMe %%cache|cache%% and can then be moved to the main array later by a process called the %%Mover|mover%%. The speeds vary:

  - SSD: 50–110 MB/s
  - NVMe: 250–900 MB/s (which can utilize 10GbE networks)

  Once data is moved to the array, it is protected by parity.

  <h4>When to use Cache Write</h4>

  - For shares with frequent write operations like applications, virtual machines, or downloads.
  - To enhance performance and reduce any perceived write latency.

  <h4>Performance Expectations</h4>

  - Without a cache drive: Average 20–30 MB/s, with peaks up to 40 MB/s.
  - With SSD cache: 50–110 MB/s.
  - With NVMe cache: 250–900 MB/s depending on network or drive constraints.

  :::tip

  Consider using a cache pool (multiple devices) for added redundancy and data protection before the %%Mover|mover%% runs.

  :::

</details>

:::info Automated Solutions

- The **Auto** mode (a future feature) will engage turbo write only when all drives are already spinning.
- Community plugins (search for "Turbo Write" in the Apps tab) may offer enhanced automation or scheduling options.

:::

To change Write Mode:

1. Navigate to ***Settings → Disk Settings***.
2. Locate **Tunable (md\_write\_method)**.
3. Choose your preferred mode:
   - **Read/Modify/Write** (default)
   - **Reconstruct Write** (Turbo Write)
   - **Auto** (future feature)
4. Click **Apply** to confirm your choice.

:::important Quick recap

- Use **Turbo Write** when you need speed, but be aware of increased power consumption and drive spin-up.
- Utilize **Cache Write** for optimal performance, particularly with SSD or NVMe drives.
- For most users, the default write mode offers the best balance unless you specifically need higher speeds.

## Read modes

When using Unraid, the speed at which you can read files is mainly determined by the individual drive that holds each file. Unlike traditional %%RAID|raid%% systems, which combine multiple drives to improve performance, Unraid stores each file on a single disk. This means read speeds won't be boosted by the combined speeds of multiple drives.

<h3>Performance expectations</h3>

- **Typical single HDD:** 70–250 MB/s (depends on drive model, age, and data location)
- **Typical SATA SSD:** 400–550 MB/s
- **NVMe SSD (in a pool):** 250–7,000 MB/s (PCIe generation and network/PCIe limitations apply; e.g., 10GbE network caps at \~1,100 MB/s)

:::note Special cases

- If a disk is disabled and its data is being reconstructed, Unraid will use the remaining drives along with parity information to recreate the data. During this process, the read speed may slow down to 30–60 MB/s or even lower, depending on the slowest drive in your system.
- Any ongoing operations in the array, such as a %%parity check|parity-check%% or rebuilding a drive, can also affect read performance. This is due to increased movement of the drive heads and overall contention for resources.

## Cache pools

%%Cache pools|cache-pool%% in Unraid provide significant advantages, particularly for write-heavy tasks, virtual machines (VMs), and Docker containers. These pools operate separately from the main array and can be set up with multiple drives using either the %%BTRFS|btrfs%% or %%ZFS|zfs%% file system, supporting various %%RAID|raid%% configurations for speed and data protection.

<h3>Cache pools vs. the main array</h3>

| Feature                 | Cache pool (BTRFS)                                                                                               | Cache pool (ZFS)                                                                                                           | Main array (Unraid)                                |

\**Actual NVMe speeds depend on PCIe generation, cooling, and network bandwidth (e.g., 10GbE caps at \~1,100 MB/s).*

<h4>Pros of cache pools</h4>

- **Higher performance:** NVMe pools can saturate 10GbE/40GbE networks (1,100–3,500 MB/s).
- **Flexible RAID:** Both %%BTRFS|btrfs%% and %%ZFS|zfs%% support %%RAID 1|raid1%%/%%RAID 10|raid10%% for redundancy without matching drive sizes.
- **Low latency:** Ideal for databases, VMs, and Docker containers.
- **ZFS advantages:** %%ZFS|zfs%% provides enterprise-grade features like data integrity checking, compression, and snapshots.

<h4>Cons of cache pools</h4>

- **No parity protection:** Data is unprotected until moved to the array.
- **Recovery risks:** %%BTRFS|btrfs%% %%RAID 5|raid5%%/%%RAID 6|raid6%% is unstable; single-drive pools lack redundancy.
- **ZFS considerations:** %%ZFS|zfs%% requires more RAM and has stricter hardware requirements than %%BTRFS|btrfs%%.

## Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting array start failures

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

If your array won't start, follow these steps to identify and fix common problems. Look for error messages under ***Main → Array Operation***.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="missing-disks" label="Missing disks" default>
    **Message:**
    `Too many wrong and/or missing disks!`

    ![Single parity error](/img/Toomanywrong.png)

    With **one %%parity drive|parity-drives%%**, you can only have **one** missing disk. With two %%parity drives|parity-drives%%, **two** disks can be missing and you can still start the array, and so on. Parity helps until you can replace the missing disk.

    **What to Do:**
    Replace the missing disk.  For dual-parity configurations, replace the missing disks one at a time.
    If you can't recover the data (or if more than 2 disks fail in a dual-parity setup), go to ***Tools → New Config*** to perform the New Config procedure.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="device-limit" label="Device limit">
    **Message:**
    `Too many attached devices.  Please consider upgrading your registration key.`

    ![Device Limit Error](/img/Toomanydevices.png)

    The rules for connecting storage apply only before starting the array. After the array is started, you can add more storage, including USB drives for virtual machines. However, be aware that Unraid currently only limits the number of attached storage devices on the [**Starter license tier**](https://unraid.net/pricing)
    (6 device limit).

    :::tip

    The maximum applies to all devices except the boot USB.

    :::
    To resolve this error:

    1. Stop the array.
    2. Remove any unneeded storage devices.
    3. Start the array.
    4. Reconnect devices afterwards for **Unassigned Devices** use.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="key-issues" label="License issues">
    **Message:**
    `Invalid or missing registration key.`

    ![Missing Key](/img/Invalidormissingkey.png)

    A valid registration key is required in order to start the array. To purchase or get a trial key:

    1. Go to ***Tools → Registration***.
    2. Click **Get Trial Key** or **Purchase Key**.
    3. Install the key by returning to **Registration**, pasting in the field, and clicking the **Install Key** button.

    :::note Trial vs. Paid Licenses

    - **Trial License:** Full Unraid access for 30 days, just like the higher license tiers. You can use unlimited storage devices, but you'll need an internet connection to start it up.  [Start a new trial here.](https://unraid.net/getting-started)

    - **Paid License:** This is yours to keep forever! However, there are limits on the number of devices based on the plan you choose (**Starter**, **Unleased**, or **Lifetime**). After you activate it, you don't have to connect to the internet anymore.

    :::

    :::tip

    If you see an "invalid key" error, it might mean your trial has **expired**. To keep using Unraid, you can [purchase a license here](https://unraid.net/pricing).

    :::

    :::caution Blacklisted USB flash devices

    If your server is online and your trial hasn't run out, your USB flash drive might have a %%GUID|guid%% that can't register a key. This can happen if the %%GUID|guid%% isn't unique or has already registered by someone else. Using an SD card reader via USB can also cause this issue since it often has a generic %%GUID|guid%%. If your USB flash drive is **blacklisted**, it can't be used anymore, and you'll need to find a different device for your Unraid Server OS installation.

    :::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="key-server" label="Key server connection">
    **Message:**
    `Cannot contact key-server`

    If you have a Trial license, you'll see a message indicating that you need to contact the Unraid license server to start your array. However, if you have a paid license, you can start the array without any extra steps.

    For Trial users, your server tries to connect to the license key server to check your license when it first boots up. If it can't connect within 30 seconds, the array won't start. But don't worry! Each time you refresh or navigate the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, it will try again to validate your license quickly. Once it successfully validates, your server won't need to check again unless you reboot.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="withdrawn" label="Withdrawn release">
    **Message:** `This Unraid release has been withdrawn.`

    If you see this message, it means you're using a beta or release candidate version of Unraid that isn't enabled for regular use.

    To resolve this:

    1. Open Unraid.
    2. Go to ***Tools → Update OS***.
    3. Install the latest stable version.

    Once the update is complete, restart your server to start your array.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Disk failure during a rebuild

If a second disk fails while you're rebuilding another one, what you can do will depend on your parity setup.

<h4>Single %%parity disk|parity-drives%%</h4>

If one disk fails during the rebuild of another, the rebuild will stop because the data can't be accurately restored. Unfortunately, you won't be able to recover your data in this situation.

<h4>Dual %%parity disk|parity-drives%%</h4>

If you have two %%parity drives|parity-drives%%, you have more options:

- You can wait for the first rebuild to finish and then deal with the second failed disk.
- Or, you can stop the current rebuild, replace the second failed disk, and then start the array to rebuild both disks at the same time.

If the first rebuild is almost done, it's usually better to let it finish. If it just started, it might be faster to rebuild both together.

:::warning

Rebuilding disks puts a lot of stress on all drives, which increases the chance of new failures. Always check drive health using %%SMART reports|smart-report%% before starting a rebuild.

:::

:::info Rebuild Time

Be prepared for the rebuild process to take several hours. The time can vary based on disk size and how busy your system is. Larger disks and busy systems may take longer.
