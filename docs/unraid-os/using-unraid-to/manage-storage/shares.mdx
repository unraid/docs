# Shares

A key feature of Unraid is the management of shares. Shares are folders or drives on your Unraid server that can be accessed over a network. You can create as many shares as you want on your Unraid server. These shares can be secured, and their configuration determines how data is written and distributed across your %%array|array%% or named %%pool|cache-pool%% of drives.

Unraid offers two types of shares to optimize your data management:

- [**User Shares**](#user-shares): These utilize **Linux FUSE** and represent folders within the broader file system.
- [**Disk Shares**](#disk-shares): These share the entire disk using the drive’s [file system](./file-systems.mdx).

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '500px'}}>
  ![User Shares vs. Disk Shares](/img/usersharesvsdiskshares.png)
</div>

It's important to remember that both share types present different views of the same underlying file system; any file or folder visible in a %%user share|user-share%% will also appear under the disk share for its respective physical drive.

When you start services like Docker or %%VM|vm%% Manager, Unraid automatically creates a [set of default user shares](#default-shares) designed to support common plugins, Docker containers, and %%virtual machines (VMs)|vm%%. You can conveniently create additional shares for your personal data as needed.

:::note

To manage your shares, simply navigate to the **Shares** tab in %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. Here, you can easily enable or disable shares through ***Settings → Global Share Settings***. By default, %%user shares|user-share%% are enabled, providing a straightforward starting point for your file organization.

:::

---

## User shares

%%User shares|user-share%% provide an aggregated view of top-level folders with the same name across %%cache|cache%% and array drives. The share name corresponds to the folder name, creating a unified network-accessible view that spans multiple drives. It's important to note that while directories appear merged, individual files remain stored on a single drive.

### Managing user shares

You can access and manage %%User shares|user-share%% from the **Shares** tab in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. This interface allows you to:

- Review all existing shares
- Create new shares
- Modify or delete existing shares

Any top-level folder that is manually created on a drive is automatically recognized as a User Share and assigned default attributes.

### File system structure

At the Linux level, %%User shares|user-share%% are accessible under `/mnt/user`, which combines files from both the %%array|array%% and %%pools|cache-pool%%. This logical view overlays the physical file system, meaning files are also visible through **Disk Shares** at the drive level.

:::warning

The deprecated `/mnt/user0` mount point (which excludes %%pool|cache-pool%% files) may be removed in future Unraid releases.

:::

### Storage allocation

The physical drive that stores a file is determined by share settings such as %%Allocation Method|allocation-method%%, %%Included/Excluded Disks|included-or-excluded-disks%%, and %%Split Level|split-level%%. Changes to these settings will affect only new files; existing files will remain untouched unless moved manually.

:::caution[Critical]

**Do not mix User Shares and Disk Shares**

Never copy or move files directly between a **user share** and a **disk share** (for example, between `/mnt/user/share` and `/mnt/disk1/share`) - especially if the folder names are the same. This can cause file corruption or permanent data loss.

For safe file management practices and more details, see the [Disk share guidelines](#disk-share-guidelines) below.

:::

### Add a share

Before creating a share, consider how you'll use it, your performance needs, security, and where files should be stored.

:::important[Share names]

Even though network shares (%%SMB|samba%%) don't care about capitalization (e.g., `MEDIA` is the same as `media`), Linux file systems do. Avoid using names that are identical but only differ in case to prevent issues.

:::

To add a share:

1. Go to the **Shares** tab and click **Add Share**.
2. Pick a unique name for your share, like `Media` or `Documents`.
3. Configure optional settings:
   - **Comments**: Write a short description to identify your share (e.g., "Family Photos").
   - **Minimum Free Space**: Decide on a minimum amount of free space (e.g., `50GB` for large files). For more details, see [Minimum free space](#minimum-free-space).
4. Select storage locations:
   - **Primary Storage**: Choose where the share will initially be stored (e.g., %%cache|cache%%, %%array|array%%, or a specific %%pool|cache-pool%%).
   - **Secondary Storage**: Set an overflow location that can be used when primary storage is full, and also serves as the final destination for the share once the %%Mover|mover%% runs.
   - For more details, see [Primary and secondary storage](#primary-and-secondary-storage).
5. Set data rules:
   - **%%Allocation Method|allocation-method%%**: Pick how data will be stored - options include high-water, fill-up, or most-free. For more details, see [Allocation method](#allocation-method).
   - **%%Split Level|split-level%%**: Determine how folders should be organized. For more details, see [Split level](#split-level).
6. Manage drives:
   - **Included Disks**: Choose specific drives to include (e.g., `disk1,disk2`).
   - **Excluded Disks**: Specify any drives you want to exclude (like older drives).
   - For more details, see [Included or excluded disks](#included-or-excluded-disks).
7. (Optional) Configure Mover settings:
   - **Mover Action**: Decide the direction of data movement (either *Primary → Secondary* or *Secondary → Primary*).
   - For more details, see [Moving files between cache and array](#moving-files-between-cache-and-array).
8. Click **Add Share** to finish setting up your new share.

:::important

By default, a new share will not be shared over the network. You must configure [network access](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/security-fundamentals.mdx#managing-network-visibility-of-shares) after the share is created.

:::

:::tip

You can configure either **Included** or **Excluded Disks**, but not both at the same time.

:::

### Delete a share

:::important

To prevent any potential data loss, shares that contain data cannot be deleted. You must either delete or relocate all contents within the share first. Always double-check to confirm that the share is empty before proceeding with its removal.

:::

#### Delete a share containing data

For shares containing data:

1. Empty the share:
   - Use the built-in **File Manager** accessible through ***Tools → File Manager*** or click the ![File Manager](/img/filemanager.png) icon in the top-right corner.
   - Find your share in **Shares** and click the **Browse** icon.
   - Delete or move all files using the file manager.

   :::note[Alternative methods]

   You can also:

   - **Use the command line**: Open the **Web Terminal** (***Tools → Terminal***) or connect via %%SSH|ssh%%, then run `rm -rf /mnt/user/[share_name]/*` (replace `[share_name]` with your share's name).

   - **Use network access**: Connect via **Windows Explorer** (%%SMB|samba%%) or **macOS Finder** (%%AFP|AFP%%/%%SMB|samba%%) and manually delete the files.

   :::caution

   The `rm -rf` command will permanently delete files. Double-check before using it. Make sure no Docker or %%VM|vm%% services are using the share before you delete it.

   :::

2. Delete the share:
   - Go back to **Shares** and click the now-empty share.
   - Check the **Delete** box and click **Delete**.
   - Confirm and click **Done**.

#### Delete an empty share

To delete a share that's already empty:

1. Go to the **Shares** tab.
2. Click the share you want to delete.
3. Check the box next to **Delete**. The button changes to **Delete**.
4. Click **Delete**.
5. Confirm and click **Done**.

## Share settings

### Minimum free space

The **Minimum Free Space** setting works in conjunction with the %%allocation method|allocation-method%% and %%split level|split-level%% to determine where new files are stored. This setting specifies the amount of free space that must remain on a drive for it to be considered eligible for new file writes. If a drive's free space falls below this threshold, Unraid will stop placing new data on that drive, provided that the %%split level|split-level%% permits splitting to another disk.

#### How it works

When transferring a file (e.g., `file.eg`), Unraid selects a disk based on available settings but cannot predict the final size of the file. If the chosen disk runs out of space during the transfer, the operation will fail with a "disk full" error. To prevent this, set the **Minimum Free Space** to a value that is larger than your largest file. This ensures that Unraid avoids disks that cannot accommodate the entire file.

#### Recommendation

Set this value to **twice the size of your largest file**. For example:

- If your largest file is 8GB, then set Minimum Free Space to 16GB.

This buffer accounts for variations in file sizes and helps prevent transfer failures.

#### Configuration

- Enter the value in KB, MB, GB, or TB (e.g., `50GB`).
- New %%user shares|user-share%% default to 10% of the disk’s total capacity.

:::warning

Always configure **Minimum Free Space** when using the *fill-up* %%allocation method|allocation-method%%. If you do not set it, you may encounter "disk full" errors during write operations.

:::

:::caution

There is a separate **Minimum Free Space** setting for %%cache pools|cache-pool%%. You can access this by going to the **Main** tab and clicking on a %%pool|cache-pool%%. Make sure to set this value higher than your largest file to avoid overfilling, especially for shares configured with *Yes* or *Prefer* cache modes.

:::

#### Limitations

- Unraid prioritizes %%split level|split-level%% rules over free space settings. If splitting is not allowed, files may still fill up a disk regardless of the free space threshold.
- Updating existing files (for example, when growing backup files) does not trigger redistribution, which can lead to "disk full" errors as time goes on.

For more detailed guidance, use the **Help** icon in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% while configuring your shares.

## Primary and secondary storage

Unraid’s storage management lets you control where new files are written and how data moves between %%pools|cache-pool%%, %%cache|cache%%, and the %%array|array%%. The options and terminology differ between Unraid 6.12+ and earlier versions.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="6.12" label="Unraid 6.12 and later" default>
    <SharesPrimaryStorage612 />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="6.11" label="Unraid 6.11 and earlier">
    <SharesPrimaryStorage611 />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

### Moving files between cache and array

Unraid provides a straightforward way to manage file placement between %%cache pools|cache-pool%% and %%array|array%%, allowing you to optimize performance and manage your data effectively. The key is to set up your share settings based on your preferred data flow and let the %%Mover|mover%% handle file transfers automatically according to its schedule.

:::tip[Scheduling the Mover]

You can configure the [%%Mover|mover%% schedule](../../getting-started/set-up-unraid/customize-unraid-settings.mdx#scheduler) by going to **Settings → Scheduler → Mover Settings**. Running it automatically during off-peak hours helps move files between the %%cache|cache%% and %%array|array%% without requiring manual action.

:::

#### Cache to array

*Use case:* Moving files from your high-speed %%cache|cache%% to the %%array|array%% for long-term storage.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="6.12+" label="Unraid 6.12+" default>
    <SharesCacheToArray612 />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="6.11" label="Unraid 6.11 or below">
    <SharesCacheToArray611 />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Array to cache

*Use case:* Improving performance for Docker containers and %%VMs|vm%% by moving files to the %%cache|cache%%.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="6.12+" label="Unraid 6.12+" default>
    <SharesArrayToCache612 />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="6.11+" label="Unraid 6.11 or below">
    <SharesArrayToCache611 />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Enabling Mover logging for troubleshooting]

If you run into issues with file movement, you can enable **Mover logging** through the ***Settings → Scheduler → Mover Settings*** page. This logs every file moved and can be viewed in ***Tools → System Log***.

:::

:::caution[Critical steps for both directions]

- Make sure your %%parity|parity%% is valid before moving files from the %%array|array%% to the %%cache|cache%%.
- If dealing with large datasets, keep an eye on %%Mover|mover%% activity via the logs.
- If files appear to be "stuck," consider temporarily disabling Docker and the %%VM|vm%% Manager, then running the %%Mover|mover%% manually via ***Main → Array Operation → Move***.

### Allocation method

When you create a new user share or add any file or folder inside it, the system needs to decide where to store this data. Usually, it will choose the data disk that has the most free space available. However, you can adjust how this decision is made using certain settings.

There are three straightforward options you can select for how the system allocates storage for your user share:

#### High-Water (Recommended)

**How it works**

The **High-water** method progressively fills disks using "switch points" based on half the largest drive's capacity. This balances disk usage while keeping related files together and minimizing drive spin-ups.

**Example with 8TB, 3TB, and 2TB drives**

1. **First pass:** Fill 8TB drive until 4TB free remains (half of 8TB).
2. **Second pass:** Fill 8TB/3TB drives until 2TB free remains.
3. **Third pass:** Fill all drives until 1TB free remains.

**Best for:**

- Media servers (e.g., Plex)
- Scenarios where keeping files on fewer disks improves spin-down efficiency
- Arrays with mixed drive sizes

:::note
High-water is the default method and works well for most users. It reduces drive thrashing compared to "Most-free."
:::

#### Most-Free

**How it works**

The **Most-free** method selects the disk with the most free space for each new file. This maximizes storage efficiency but increases drive thrashing.

**Performance impact**

- Frequent disk switches keep multiple drives spun up
- May reduce %%parity|parity%% write speeds due to overlapping operations

**Best for:**

- High-throughput workflows (e.g., video editing)
- Temporary or %%cache|cache%%-like data
- Arrays where performance outweighs power savings

:::tip
Combine with %%split level|split-level%% settings to group related files despite frequent disk switching.
:::

#### Fill-Up

**How it works**

The **Fill-up** method writes to disks in numeric order until they reach the **Minimum Free Space** threshold, then moves to the next disk.

**Requirements**

- Always set **Minimum Free Space** (e.g., 2x largest file size)
- Configure **Split Level** to control file grouping

**Best for:**

- Static data archives
- Users who prefer manual disk management
- Arrays with identical drive sizes

:::caution
Without **Minimum Free Space** configured, "disk full" errors will occur when a drive nears capacity.
:::

---

### Split level

The **Split Level** setting in Unraid helps manage how files and folders are organized across multiple disks. It determines how deep folder structures can go on different disks while keeping certain files together. The %%split level|split-level%% is numbered starting from 1, where the top level (the main share) is considered level 1.

#### Automatically Split Any Directory (Default)

**Behavior**

Unraid creates any required folders on the selected disk, regardless of folder depth. New files and folders are placed based on %%allocation method|allocation-method%% and available space, even if their parent directories do not already exist on that disk.

**Use Case**

Best for general data shares where folder structure is not critical, such as downloads or mixed media libraries. Allows maximum flexibility for file placement and disk utilization.

#### Automatically Split Only Top Level

**Behavior**

Unraid will only create first-level subfolders on a disk if they don't already exist. For deeper folders, new files and folders are placed on the disk where the parent directory exists.

**Use Case**

Ideal for media libraries (e.g., Movies/Title) where you want all files for a specific subfolder (like a movie or TV show) to remain together on the same disk.

#### Automatically Split Top 'N' Levels

**Behavior**

You specify how many directory levels (N) Unraid will manage automatically. For folders at or above level N, Unraid can create them as needed. For deeper levels, new files are placed on the disk where the parent directory exists.

**Use Case**

Useful for complex folder structures, such as nested project directories, where you want to keep related content grouped together beyond just the top level.

#### Manual (No Automatic Splitting)

**Behavior**

Unraid only places new files or folders on disks where the parent directory already exists. No new directories are created automatically.

**Use Case**

Best for advanced users who want full manual control over file placement, or for archival data where folder structure must remain fixed.

:::important

If there are conflicts between **Minimum Free Space**, **Split Level**, and %%Allocation Method|allocation-method%%, the **Split Level** setting takes priority. This may result in "out of space" errors, even if other drives have available space.

:::

---

### Included or excluded disks

These settings help you manage which drives can hold files for your share. You can either include specific disks or exclude certain ones - just don’t do both at the same time! If you don’t choose any specific disks, all drives allowed in ***Settings → Global Share Settings*** will be used.

Unraid first checks any included disks, then looks at excluded disks to determine where to store a file. After that, it uses the %%split level|split-level%% and %%allocation method|allocation-method%% to select an appropriate disk.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '272px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![Disk selection logic](/img/diskselectionlogic.png)
</div>

:::important

The settings for %%included and excluded disks|included-or-excluded-disks%% only affect where new files can be saved. Any existing files in folders that match your share name will still be accessible for reading, even if they’re on a different disk.

:::

#### Included Disks

**Behavior**

Unraid will only consider the listed disks when deciding where to place new files for the share. All other disks are ignored for new writes, but files already present on other disks remain accessible for reading.

**Use Case**

Use this setting if you want to restrict a share to certain disks, such as keeping important documents on newer or higher-capacity drives, or isolating a media library to specific disks for performance or organizational reasons.

#### Excluded Disks

**Behavior**

Unraid will use all eligible disks except those listed here when placing new files for the share. As with included disks, files already present on excluded disks remain accessible for reading.

**Use Case**

Use this setting to prevent a share from using certain disks, such as excluding older drives, slower disks, or drives reserved for other data types.

---

### Default shares

When you use Unraid with **Docker** or %%Virtual Machines (VMs)|vm%%, it automatically creates some default shares.

:::important

These shares are only created after you start their respective services (Docker or %%VM|vm%% Manager). If you don't see these shares, make sure Docker and/or %%VM|vm%% Manager are enabled and running.

:::

You don’t have to use these shares if you don’t want to, and you can remove them if you prefer, but we usually recommend keeping them for convenience. These shares help keep things organized and make it easier for everyone to get support if they run into issues.

Here’s a quick overview of what each default share is for:

- `appdata`: This is where all the working files for your Docker containers are stored. Each Docker container usually has its own folder here.
- `system`: This share holds the essential files for your Docker applications and the XML templates for your %%VMs|vm%%.
- `domains`: This share is designated for storing virtual disk images (vdisks) that your %%VMs|vm%% use.
- `isos`: This is where you can save CD ISO images that you want to use with your %%VMs|vm%%.

:::important

It's best not to change the permissions on most of these default shares because doing so might cause issues with how Docker containers and %%VMs|vm%% work. The only share where changing permissions is recommended is the `isos` share, as this one can be accessed over the network for adding new ISO files for %%virtual machines|vm%%.

:::

---

## Disk shares

Disk shares are simply individual drives or %%pools|cache-pool%% of drives within your Unraid system that can be accessed over the network. By default, these shares are turned off, but you can easily enable them in the ***Settings → Global Share Settings*** section.

To keep things secure, make sure to set [user access permissions](../../system-administration/secure-your-server/user-management.mdx) for these shares appropriately. This is especially important if you have multiple users accessing your network.

To enable disk shares:

1. Navigate to **Settings**.
2. Click on **Global Share Settings**.
3. Turn on disk shares to make them visible in your network.

Once you enable them, you'll notice disk shares in the Unraid GUI under a section labeled **Disk Shares** in the **Shares** tab. Each drive in your %%array|array%% can be accessed like this:

- **Individual drives:** These appear as `/mnt/diskX` where X is the disk number (e.g., `disk1`, `disk2`, etc.).
- **Pools of drives:** If you have multiple drives grouped together, they will show up as `/mnt/pool-name`. The most common %%pools|cache-pool%% is called `cache`, but you can name your %%pools|cache-pool%% however you like.

:::important

The Unraid flash device, which stores your Unraid settings, is not treated as a disk share. If you want it to be accessible over the network, you can set it up as a share named 'flash'. This device is mounted at `/boot` in Linux.

For security, it's best to keep your shares in *Private* mode and only grant access to trusted users.

:::

### Disk share guidelines

:::danger[Important Reminder]

**Never copy files directly between a user share and a disk share** if their folder names are the same. This could lead to files being corrupted or deleted, resulting in permanent data loss.

:::

**User shares** and **disk shares** may look different in the interface but can point to the same files on the disk. Linux commands like `cp` or `rsync` cannot always tell the difference, which can accidentally lead to overwriting or deleting files.

**Safe copying tips**

1. **Stick to one type of share:**
   - Only copy files between either %%user shares|user-share%% OR disk shares, not both at the same time.
   - *Example:* To copy a file from one user share to another: `cp /mnt/user/share1/file /mnt/user/share2/file`

2. **Use external drives safely:**
   - Connect external drives using the **[Unassigned Devices plugin](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=unassigned+devices#r:~:text=don%27t%20be%20carefull!!!-,Unassigned%20Devices,-dlandon)** to prevent issues.
   - Copy files from `/mnt/disks/` instead of from the main %%array|array%% or %%cache|cache%% paths.

3. **Verify your copies:** When moving files locally, you can use `rsync -c` to check that the files copied over correctly.

4. **Don't mix share types:** Avoid using paths that mix %%user shares|user-share%% and disk shares, such as `/mnt/user/share/` with `/mnt/disk1/share/` in the same command.

:::tip[Transferring files from external network shares]

If you need to transfer files from external Windows or Linux network shares (SMB/CIFS) to your Unraid server using command-line tools, see [File transfer operations](../../system-administration/advanced-tools/command-line-interface.mdx#file-transfer-operations) in the Command line interface documentation.
