If you haven’t done so already, please review the [Overview & system prep](./overview-and-system-prep.mdx) instruction to ensure your hardware and shares are ready for virtualization.

## Creating your own virtual machines

With your system prepared and preferences set, you can create a new %%virtual machine (VM)|vm%% using the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.

:::note Before you begin

- Confirm your `isos` and `domains` shares are configured and accessible. Learn more about [share management](../manage-storage/shares.mdx) here.
- Upload your operating system installation ISO and, for Windows %%VMs|vm%%, the latest %%VirtIO|virtio%% drivers ISO to the `isos` share.
- Decide whether you will use %%GPU passthrough|gpu-passthrough%% or %%VNC|vnc-session%% for graphics.

:::

To create a basic %%VM|vm%%:

1. Click **Add VM** from the **Virtual Machines** page.
2. Set the **Template** to **Custom**, or select a predefined OS template for common distributions.
3. Enter a **Name** and, optionally, a **Description** for your %%VM|vm%%.
4. Toggle **Autostart** if you want the %%VM|vm%% to start automatically with the %%array|array%%.
5. Select the **Operating System** type. This will also adjust the %%VM|vm%% icon.
6. Assign **CPU cores** to the %%VM|vm%%. You can assign up to the number of physical cores available on your host.
7. Specify the **Initial Memory** (RAM) for the %%VM|vm%%. Refer to your guest OS documentation for recommended values.
8. Choose the **OS Install ISO** from your **isos** share.
9. Configure the **Primary vDisk** (location, size, and type).
   - The primary %%vDisk|vdisk%% stores the VM’s operating system.
   - Add additional %%vDisks|vdisk%% as needed using the plus sign.
10. Select a **Graphics Card**:
    - Choose %%VNC|vnc-session%% for remote access or select a physical GPU for passthrough.
    - Assign a USB keyboard/mouse if using a physical GPU.
    - Set a %%VNC|vnc-session%% password if desired.
11. Assign a **Sound Card** (optional, but required for HDMI audio via GPU).
12. Assign **USB Devices** as needed.
    - Devices must be attached before starting the %%VM|vm%% (USB hot-plugging is not supported).
    - The Unraid USB flash device is not available for assignment.
13. Click **Create VM**. The %%VM|vm%% will start automatically unless you uncheck **Start VM after creation**.

## Binding PCI devices for passthrough

Before you can assign a GPU or any PCI device to a %%virtual machine|vm%%, it's important to “bind” the device to the **vfio-pci** driver. This process hides the device from Unraid and dedicates it solely to your %%VM|vm%%.

To bind a PCI device (GPU, USB controller, NVMe, etc.) for passthrough:

1. Navigate to ***Tools → System Devices*** in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
2. Look through the list of all detected PCI devices and their %%IOMMU|iommu%% groups.
3. Check the box next to each device you wish to bind to **vfio-pci** (to hide it from Unraid).
   - Note that devices already in use by Unraid (such as disk controllers and network cards) cannot be selected.
   - If you select a GPU, select the associated sound device.
4. Click on **Bind Selected to VFIO at Boot** to save your changes.
5. Restart your server for the binding to take effect.

:::caution

If you make hardware changes (like adding or removing PCI devices), return to **System Devices** to ensure the correct devices are still bound. If devices are unbound or misbound, they may not appear for passthrough.

:::

After binding, bound devices will appear in the **Other PCI Devices** dropdown when editing or creating a %%VM|vm%%.

<details>
  <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

  - If you've previously used the `VFIO-PCI` Config plugin, uninstall it - this functionality is now integrated.
  - To reset all bindings, delete `/boot/config/vfio-pci.cfg` and reboot your system.
  - After rebooting, utilize the **View `VFIO-PCI` Log** button on the **System Devices** page for advanced troubleshooting.
  - Remember that if you bind your only GPU, Unraid may not boot to the GUI. Make sure you plan for this.
  - For more information, check the [official guide on the Unraid forums](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/93781-guide-bind-devices-to-vfio-pci-for-easy-passthrough-to-vms/).

## GPU passthrough for virtual machines

%%GPU passthrough|gpu-passthrough%% allows you to assign a physical graphics card directly to a %%virtual machine (VM)|vm%%, providing near-native performance for gaming, creative work, or machine learning.

:::info Why use GPU passthrough?

- **Performance:** Direct hardware access for demanding applications.
- **Compatibility:** Run graphics-intensive workloads that require a dedicated GPU.
- **Flexibility:** Transform your unraid server into a multi-purpose workstation.

:::

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

**Hardware:**

- CPU with Intel VT-d or AMD-Vi support (%%IOMMU|iommu%% enabled in BIOS).
- GPU compatible with passthrough (see [community-tested hardware](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LnGpTrXalwGVNy0PWJDURhyxa3sgqkGXmvNCIvIMenk/edit#ggid=0)).
- A motherboard that properly isolates PCIe devices.

**Software:**

- Unraid 6.9+ with virtualization enabled.
- %%OVMF|ovmf%% (%%UEFI|uefi%%) bios for %%VMs|vm%% (recommended over %%SeaBIOS|seabios%%).

To setup GPU passthrough:

1. Ensure your hardware supports %%IOMMU|iommu%% and is enabled in your BIOS.
2. Enable virtualization features in BIOS (Intel VT-x/VT-d or AMD-v/AMD-vi).
3. Update Unraid to the latest stable version.
4. Assign the GPU to the %%VM|vm%% in the %%VM|vm%% creation or edit screen under the graphics card section.
5. Assign a USB keyboard and mouse to the %%VM|vm%% if using %%GPU passthrough|gpu-passthrough%%.
6. Use %%OVMF|ovmf%% BIOS for the %%VM|vm%% for better compatibility with %%GPU passthrough|gpu-passthrough%%.
7. Start the %%VM|vm%% and verify the GPU is passed through correctly.

:::note

Some GPUs may require additional configuration or ROM injection for proper passthrough.

:::

### Manual ROM injection

Some GPUs, especially specific NVIDIA models, require a ROM file to be manually provided to the VM to initialize correctly. This is often necessary when the GPU’s onboard firmware is not correctly passed through by default, causing issues like black screens or failure to boot. Manual ROM injection is a last resort after trying BIOS and VM configuration adjustments.

To inject a ROM:

1. **Download GPU ROM:**
   - Visit [TechPowerUp VGA BIOS database](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/).
   - Search for your GPU model and download the correct ROM file.
   - Store the rom in your unraid `isos` or `domains` share.

2. **Edit %%VM|vm%% XML:**
   - Stop the %%VM|vm%% and open its XML configuration (**Edit XML** from the %%VM|vm%% context menu).
   - Locate the GPU’s `<hostdev>` block and add the `<rom>` tag:

     ```xml

     <hostdev mode='subsystem' type='pci' managed='yes'>
       <driver name='vfio'/>
       <source>
         <address domain='0x0000' bus='0x02' slot='0x00' function='0x0'/>
       </source>
       <rom file='/mnt/user/isos/gpu_roms/your_gpu.rom'/> <!-- Update path -->
       <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x05' function='0x0'/>
     </hostdev>
     ```

3. **Save and test:** Click **Update** and start the %%VM|vm%%.

## Common issues

This section covers advanced topics and solutions for common issues when managing %%virtual machines (VMs)|vm%% on Unraid. Expand the sections below for step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting tips.

### Expand a vDisk

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  If your %%VM|vm%% is running low on disk space, you can increase the size of its %%virtual disk (**vDisk**)|vdisk%% directly from the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.

  To expand a %%vDisk|vdisk%%:

  1. Go to the **VMs** tab in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
  2. Ensure the %%VM|vm%% is stopped.
  3. Click on the VM’s name to expand its details.
  4. Locate the %%vDisk|vdisk%% you want to expand. Click the value in the **Capacity** field to make it editable.
  5. Enter the new desired size (e.g., `100G` for 100 gigabytes) and press **Enter**.
  6. The new capacity is now set.

  :::note

  You cannot shrink a %%vDisk|vdisk%% from the Unraid GUI; only expansion is supported.

  :::
  <h4>Expanding the partition in your guest OS</h4>

  After resizing the %%vDisk|vdisk%%, start your %%VM|vm%%. You must expand the partition within the guest operating system to use the new space:

  - **Windows:** Use the built-in Disk Management tool to extend your partition.

  - **Linux (LVM):** Use tools like `fdisk`, `pvresize`, `lvextend`, and `resize2fs` to expand partitions and logical volumes.

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    sudo fdisk /dev/vda
    sudo pvresize /dev/vda3
    sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
    sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
    ```

    Adjust device names as needed for your setup.

  :::tip

  Always back up your %%VM|vm%% before making disk changes.

  :::

</details>

### Stuck at UEFI shell

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  If your %%VM|vm%% boots to a %%UEFI|uefi%% shell instead of your operating system, you can manually start the boot process:

  At the %%UEFI|uefi%% shell prompt, enter:

  ```bash
  fs0:
  cd efi/boot
  bootx64.efi
  ```

  The %%VM|vm%% should now continue booting into your OS.

  :::tip

  If this happens frequently, check your VM’s boot order and ensure the correct %%vDisk|vdisk%% or ISO is set as the primary boot device in the VM settings.

  :::

</details>

### Black screen after VM start

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  If your %%VM|vm%% starts but the display remains blank:

  1. **Check BIOS settings:**
     - Set primary graphics to integrated GPU (iGPU), not the passthrough GPU.
     - Update motherboard and GPU BIOS to the latest versions.

  2. **Adjust %%VM|vm%% settings:**
     - Switch from %%SeaBIOS|seabios%% to %%OVMF|ovmf%% (%%UEFI|uefi%%) in %%VM|vm%% settings.
     - Change **Machine Type** from i440fx to Q35.

  3. **Manual ROM injection (last resort):** [Inject GPU ROM manually](#manual-rom-injection).

</details>

### Error: "Failed to set IOMMU for container: operation not permitted"

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand/collapse</strong></summary>

  This error typically indicates %%IOMMU|iommu%% group conflicts or missing interrupt remapping:

  1. **Enable PCIe ACS override:**
     - Go to ***Settings → VM Manager***.
     - Set **PCIe ACS override** to *Downstream* or *Both*.
     - Reboot Unraid.

  2. **Allow unsafe interrupts (advanced):**
     - Edit `syslinux.cfg` on your unraid flash drive:

       ```bash
       append vfio_iommu_type1.allow_unsafe_interrupts=1 initrd=/bzroot
       ```

     - Only use this if you fully trust your %%VM|vm%% guests.

  :::note
