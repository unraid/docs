## Version 6.10.3 2022-06-14

### Improvements

Fixed data corruption issue which could occur on some platforms, notably HP Microserver Gen8/9, when Intel VT-d was enabled.
This was fixed by changing the Linux kernel default IOMMU operation mode from "DMA Translation" to "Pass-through".

- Also removed 'tg3' blacklisting when Intel VT-d was enabled. This was added in abundance of caution because all early
  reports of data corruption involved platforms which also (coincidentally) used 'tg3' network driver. If you created a
  blank 'config/modprobe.d/tg3.conf' file you may remove it.

**Plugin authors:** A plugin file may include an `<ALERT>` tag which displays a markdown formatted message when a new version is available.
Use this to give instructions or warnings to users before the upgrade is done.

Brought back color-coding in logging windows.

### Bug fixes

Fix issue detecting Mellanox NIC.

Misc. WebGUI bug fixes
