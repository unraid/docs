# Version 6.12.3 2023-07-14

Changes vs. [6.12.2](6.12.2.mdx)

## Upgrade notes

### Known issues

Please see the [6.12.0 release notes](6.12.0.mdx#known-issues) for general known issues.

### Rolling back

If rolling back earlier than 6.12.0, also see the [6.12.0 release notes](6.12.0.mdx#rolling-back).

## Networking

This release has fixes for networking, particularly as it relates to IPv6. A side effect is that this should resolve
an issue where the WebGUI will not load in certain instances.

Note: If you have code in your 'go' script to disable IPv6, remove that and disable it via the 'Settings/Network Settings'
 page instead. Manually disabling IPv6 will cause conflicts.

## Docker

This release resolves an issue where Docker does not properly stop when the array Stops, which can result in an unclean shutdown.

If Docker containers have issues starting after a while, and you are running Plex, go to your Plex Docker container settings,
switch to advanced view, and add this to the Extra Params: `--no-healthcheck`
