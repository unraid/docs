# Version 6.12.0 2023-06-14

## Upgrade notes

Upon boot, if all PCI devices specified in 'config/vfio-pci.cfg' do not properly bind, VM Autostart is prevented.  You may still
start individual VMs.  This is to prevent Unraid host crash if hardware PCI IDs changed because of a kernel update or physical hardware
change.  To restore VM autostart, examine '/var/log/vfio-pci-errors' and remove offending PCI IDs from 'config/vfio-pci.cfg' file and
reboot.

If you revert back from 6.12 to 6.11.5 or earlier, you have to force update all your Docker containers and start them
manually after downgrading.  This is necessary because of the underlying change to cgroup v2 starting with 6.12.0-rc1.

Linux [Multi-Gen LRU](https://lwn.net/Articles/856931/) is a relatively new feature now included but not
enabled by default. You can enable by adding this line to your 'config/go' file:

  `echo y > /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled`

If you revert back from 6.12 to 6.11.5 or earlier, you may need to remove that line.

If you created any zpools using 6.12.0-beta5, please Erase those pools and recreate.

### Obsolete/Broken plugins

There are a few plugins which are known to be incompatible with Unraid 6.12, and upon boot will not be installed. You will get a notification for each plugin

plugin-specific questions in the support thread for that plugin.

### Known issues

#### Crashes related to i915 driver

We are aware that some 11th gen Intel Rocket Lake systems are experiencing crashes related to the i915 iGPU. If your Rocket Lake system crashes under
Unraid 6.12.0, open a web terminal and type this, then reboot:

  `echo "options i915 enable_dc=0" >> /boot/config/modprobe.d/i915.conf`

Setting this option may result in higher power use but it may resolve this issue for these GPUs.

#### Call traces related to macvlan

If "Docker custom network type" is set to "macvlan" you may get call traces and crashes on 6.12 even if you did not on 6.11. If so, we recommend
changing to "ipvlan", or if you have two network cards you can avoid the issue completely: refer
to [this Community forum post](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/137048-guide-how-to-solve-macvlan-and-ipvlan-issues-with-containers-on-a-custom-network/).

## ZFS pools

New in this release is the ability to create a ZFS file system in a user-defined pool.  You may also format any data
device in the unRAID array with a single-device ZFS file system.  For a good overview of ZFS,
see [this article](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/05/zfs-101-understanding-zfs-storage-and-performance/).

We are splitting full ZFS implementation across two Unraid OS releases.  Initial support in this release includes:

- Support raid0, mirror, raidz1, raidz2 and raidz3 root profiles.  Up to 4-way mirror in a mirror vdev.  Multiple vdev groups.
- Support removing single device: if device is still present in server, 'wipefs' is used to clear the partition table.
- Support replacing single missing device with a new device of same or larger size.
- Support scheduled trimming of ZFS pools.
- Support pool rename.
- Pool names must begin with a lowercase letter and only contain lowercase letters, digits, the underscore,
and dash.  Pool names must not end with a digit.
- Non-root vdev cannot be configured in this release, however, they can be imported.  Note: imported hybrid pools may not be
expanded in this release.
- Pools created on other systems may or may not import depending on how the pool was created.  A future update will permit
importing pools from any system.

A ZFS pool has three variables:

- profile - the root data organization: raid0, mirror (up to 4-way), raidz1, raidz2, raidz3
- width - the number of devices per root vdev
- groups - the number of root vdevs in the pool

At time of ZFS pool creation, the webGUI will present all topology options based on the number of devices assigned to the pool.

Special treatment for root single-vdev mirrors:

- A single-device ZFS pool can be converted to multiple-device mirror by adding up to 3 additional devices in one operation.
- A 2-device mirror can be increased to 3-device by adding a single device; similarly, a 3-device mirror can be increased to
4-device mirror by adding a single device.

To add an additional root vdev, you must assign 'width' number of new devices to the pool at the same time. The new vdev will be
created with the same 'profile' as the existing vdevs. Additional flexibility in adding/expanding vdevs will be provided in a future update.

Pools created with the **steini84** plugin can be imported as follows: First create a new pool with the number
of slots corresponding to the number of devices in the pool to be imported. Next assign all the devices to
the new pool.  Upon array Start the pool should be recognized, though certain zpool topologies may not be
recognized (please report). Please note that only pools using partition #1 can be imported in this release, e.g. this `lsblk` output:

```
# lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sdb           8:16   0   7.3T  0 disk
├─sdb1        8:17   0     2G  0 part
└─sdb2        8:18   0   7.3T  0 part
```

indicates that the second (`sdb2`) partition of the disk is being used for data, and **cannot** be imported. You can continue to use
the pool by importing it manually post-upgrade (after every boot), but it will not be visible in the UI. You can configure automatic import on boot
by adding `zpool import <poolname>` to your `/boot/config/go` file.

Mixed topologies are not supported.  For example, a pool with both a mirror root vdev and a raidz root vdev is not
recognized.

Autotrim can be configured as **on** or **off** (except for single-device ZFS volumes in the unRAID array).

Compression can be configured as **on** or **off**, where **on** selects **lz4**.  Future update will permit specifying other algorithms/levels.

When creating a new ZFS pool you may choose **zfs - encrypted**, which, like other encrypted volumes, applies device-level encryption
via LUKS. ZFS native encryption is not supported at this time.

During system boot, the file /etc/modprobe.d/zfs.conf is auto-generated to limit the ZFS ARC to 1/8 of installed memory.  This can
be overridden if necessary by creating a custom 'config/modprobe.d/zfs.conf' file.  Future update will include ability to configure
the ARC via webGUI, including auto-adjust according to memory pressure, e.g., VM start/stop.

Top-level user shares in a ZFS pool are created as datasets instead of ordinary directories.

## Share storage conceptual change

New in this release is a conceptual change in the way storage is assigned to shares.  The old concept of main storage being the unRAID array
with an optional "Cache" is confusing to many new users, especially since *cache* has a specific meaning in ZFS.

Also outlined below, we introduced the concept of an *exclusive share*.  This is simply a share where all the data exists in a single named
pool.  In this case, the FUSE-based User Share file system returns a **symlink** to the actual share directory in the pool.  All operations within
the share, including data transfer, therefore bypass FUSE, resulting in greater performance.  This feature is primarily aimed at maximizing
I/O for large fast ZFS pools accessed via a fast network

This is a front-end change only; existing shares will be viewed with this new structure automatically upon upgrading,
and will automatically revert to the previous style if you revert to an earlier version.

Configuring the storage options for a share is specified using two inputs:

- Primary storage
- Secondary storage

Primary storage is where **new** files/folders are created. If Primary storage is below the Minimum Free Space setting then new files
and folders will be created in Secondary storage, if configured.

Each input presents a drop-down which lists "array", "none", and each named pool as a selection according to some configuration rules:

For the Primary storage drop-down:

- the "none" option is omitted, ie, Primary storage must be selected
- any named pool can be selected
- "Array" can be selected (meaning the unRAID array)

For the Secondary storage drop-down:

- the "none" option is included, ie, Secondary storage is optional
- if Primary storage is a pool name, then the only options are "none" and "Array". In the future other pools will be listed here as well.
- if Primary storage is "Array", then only "none" appears as an option

When "Array" is selected for either Primary or Secondary storage, a set of additional settings slide in:

- Allocation method
- Included disk(s)
- Excluded disk(s)
- Split level

When a *btrfs* named pool is selected for either Primary or Secondary storage, an additional setting slides in:

- Enable Copy-on-write

When a *ZFS* named pool is selected for either Primary or Secondary storage, there are no additional settings at this time
but there could be some in the future. For example, since a share is created as a ZFS dataset, it could have a different
compression setting than the parent pool if we need to implement this.

### Mover action

When there is Secondary storage configured for a share the "Mover action" setting becomes enabled, letting the user
select the transfer direction of the mover:

- Primary to Secondary (default)
- Secondary to Primary

### Exclusive shares

We added a new setting: "Settings/Global Share Settings/Permit exclusive shares" [Yes/No] default: No.  If set to Yes
and if Primary storage for a share is a pool and Secondary storage is set to "none", then a symlink is created
in /mnt/user/*share* pointing directly to the pool share directory.  (An additional check is made to ensure the share also does
not exist on any other volumes.)

There is a new status flag, 'Exclusive access' which is set to 'Yes' when a symlink is in place; and, 'No' otherwise.
Exclusive shares are also indicated on the Shares page.

The advantage of setting up symlinks is that I/O bypasses FUSE-based user share file system (shfs) which can significantly
increase performance.

There are some restrictions:

- Both the share Min Free Space and pool Min Free Space settings are ignored when creating new files on an exclusive share.
- If a share is NFS-exported it cannot be exclusive, i.e., the syslink is not created.  This is because symlinks are resolved in
the NFS client, not the server.  We hope to lift this restriction in a future update.

### Clean Up button

Appearing on the Shares page, a button called CLEAN UP, when enabled indicates there are config/share/*share*.cfg files for
shares that do not exist. Clicking this button will remove those files.

## Other Improvements

### btrfs

Autotrim can be configured as **on** or **off** when used in a pool.

Compression can be configured as **on** or **off**.  **on** selects **zstd**. Future update to permit specifying other algorithms/levels.

### xfs

Autotrim can be configured as **on** or **off** when used as a single-slot pool.

### Docker

It is possible to configure the **Docker data-root** to be placed in a directory on a ZFS storage pool. In this
case, Docker will use the 'zfs' storage driver. This driver creates a separate dataset for each image layer. Because
of this, here is our recommendation for setting up Docker using **directory**:

First, create a **docker** user share configured as follows:

- Share name: **docker**
- Primary storage: ***name of your ZFS pool***
- Secondary storage: **none**

Next, on **Docker settings** page:

- Enable docker: **Yes**
- Docker data-root: **directory**
- Docker directory: **/mnt/user/docker**

If you ever need to delete the docker persistent state, then bring up
the Docker settings page and set **Enable docker** to **No** and click **Apply**.  After docker has shut down click
the **Delete directory** checkbox and then click **Delete**.  This
will result in deleting not only the various files and directories, but also all layers stored as datasets.

Before enabling Docker again, be sure to first re-create the **docker** share as described above.

#### Other Docker changes

### VM Manager

If you enable copy/paste for virtual consoles you need to install additional software on the client in addition to the QEMU agent
if that has been installed. [Here is the location](https://www.spice-space.org/download.html) for spice-vdagent for both Windows and Linux.
Note copy/paste function will not work with web spice viewer you need to use virt-viewer.

#### Other VM changes

- Add Serial option to vdisk.
- Spice Bug fix for users with non standard GUI ports defined.

- fixed notification subject.

### Dashboard

The webGUI Dashboard has been redesigned and it is now possible to move elements (tiles) up and down and between columns. This allows
the user to organize the tiles in any way they desire.  There is a small **lock** icon on the menu bar which must be clicked to enable
this function:

- Green is normal state (page is locked)
- Red is attention state (page is unlocked)

Note: The **lock** icon also appears on the Docker and VM pages and must be clicked to rearrange the startup order.

### Network improvements

We added a new section: Settings/Network Settings/Interface Extra

This new section allows the user to define which interfaces are used by the Unraid services. By default all regular interfaces with an
IP address are included in the list of listening interfaces.

The tunnels of the built-in WireGuard function of Unraid are automatically added or removed from the list when the Wireguard tunnels are
activated or deactivated. The user may exclude these tunnels from the list of listening interfaces.

To use the Tailscale or Zerotier interface, it is required to add the interface name or IP address of the communication to the list of
included listening interfaces.  **Important:** It is imperative that Tailscale or Zerotier container is running before the interface is
added to the list.  For more information,
refer to [this Community forum post](https://forums.unraid.net/bug-reports/prereleases/unraid-os-version-6120-rc7-available-r2427/?tab=comments#comment-24235).

### Release *bz* file differences

Unraid OS is comprised of a set of 5 so-called *bz* files in the root of the
USB Flash boot device:

- bzimage - the Linux kernel
- bzroot - the root file system, sans console desktop
- bzroot-gui - additional files needed for console desktop
- bzmodules - modules (drivers) associated with the Linux kernel
- bzfirmware - device firmware required by certain modules

Starting with 6.12 release, the content of these files has been rearranged:

- bzimage - the Linux kernel (same as before)
- bzroot - the root file system excluding the /usr directory tree
- bzroot-gui - a single file which auto-starts the console desktop (for compatibility)
- bzmodules - modules (drivers) associated with the Linux kernel and device firmware required by certain modules
- bzfirmware - the /usr directory and all files contained therein, including console desktop

These changes speed up the boot process and free up nearly 1G of RAM.  It also permits
us to add more "stuff" to Unraid OS in the future without requiring more RAM.  Finally, when booted in **non-GUI** mode,
the desktop can be started by logging in at the console and typig the 'slim' command.

#### Manual update

Manual update refers to updating Unraid OS on your USB flash boot device without using the **Tools/Update OS** function.
Typically one would either:

- open a Terminal window, wget the release zip file, unzip the release, and then 'cp' the *bz* files to root of the boot device.

or

- export the 'flash' share on your network and drag the *bz* files from a PC directly to the flash.

Either method, starting with 6.12 **can fail** because the *bzfirmware* file will be overwritten while it is
still mounted - not good.

To get around this, you must first create a temp directory on the flash device and then 'mv' (or drag)
all the existing *bz* files into this temp directory.  Now you can copy the new *bz* files to the root of
the flash device and reboot.
