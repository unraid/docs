# Version 7.2.0 2025-10-29

The Unraid webGUI is now responsive! The interface automatically adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop monitors alike. The Unraid API is now built in, and the release also brings RAIDZ expansion, Ext2/3/4, NTFS and exFAT support, and the (optional) ability to login to the webGUI via SSO, among other features and bug fixes.

Note that some plugins may have visual issues in this release; please give plugin authors time to make adjustments. Plugin authors, please see this post describing [how to update your plugins to make them responsive](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/192172-responsive-webgui-plugin-migration-guide/).

## Upgrading

## Changes vs. [7.1.4](7.1.4.md)

### Storage

#### ZFS RAIDZ expansion

You can now expand your single-vdev RAIDZ1/2/3 pools, one drive at a time:

- With the array running, on **_Main → Pool Devices_**, select the pool name to view the details
- In the **Pool Status** area, check for an **Upgrade Pool** button. If one exists, you'll need to click that before continuing. Note that upgrading the pool will limit your ability to downgrade to earlier releases of Unraid (7.1 should be OK, but not 7.0)
- Stop the array
- On **_Main → Pool Devices_**, add a slot to the pool
- Select the appropriate drive (must be at least as large as the smallest drive in the pool)
- Start the array

#### Enhancements

- Fix: There will now be an "invalid expansion" warning if the pool needs to be upgraded first
- Improvement: Better defaults for ZFS RAIDZ vdevs

#### Ext2/3/4, NTFS, and exFAT Support

Unraid now supports Ext2/3/4, NTFS, and exFAT drive formats in addition to XFS, BTRFS, and ZFS.

Use case: say you are a content creator with a box full of hard drives containing all of your historical videos. When first creating an array (or after running **_Tools → New Config_**), add all of your existing data drives (blank, or with data in a supported drive format) to the array. Any parity drives will be overwritten but the data drives will retain their data. You can enjoy parity protection, share them on the network, and take full advantage of everything Unraid has to offer.

Critical note: you can continue adding filled data drives to the array up until you start the array with a parity drive installed. Once a parity drive has been added, any new data drives will be zeroed out when they are added to the array.

To clarify, Unraid has always worked this way; what is new is that Unraid now supports additional drive formats.

Additionally, you can create single drive pools using the new formats as well.

- Improved the usability of the **File System Type** dropdown as the list of available options is growing

#### Warn about deprecated file systems

The **_Main_** page will now warn if any array or pool drives are formatted with ReiserFS; these drives need to be migrated to another filesystem ASAP as they will not be usable in a future release of Unraid (likely Unraid 7.3). Similarly, it will warn if there are drives formatted in a deprecated version of XFS; those need to be migrated before 2030. See [Converting to a new file system type](../using-unraid-to/manage-storage/file-systems.mdx#converting-to-a-new-file-system-type) in the docs for details.

#### Other storage changes

- Improvement: Two-device ZFS pools are mirrored by default, but you can make them RAIDZ1 if you plan to expand that vdev in the future
- Improvement: Add **File system status** to **DeviceInfo** page, showing whether a drive is mounted/unmounted and empty/not empty
- Fix: Display issue on Main page when two pools are named similarly
- Fix: [glibc bug](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/17629) which could lead to data loss with ZFS
- Fix: BTRFS array disks with multiple filesystem signatures don't mount
- Fix: Resolved some issues for parity disks with existing 1MiB aligned partitions
- Fix: When stopping array, do not attempt 'umount' on array devices that are not mounted
- Improvement: Exclusive shares may be selected for NFS export
- Improvement: Disallow shares named `homes`, `global`, and `printers` (these have special meaning in Samba)
- Fix: Correct handling of case-insensitive share names
- Fix: Shares with invalid characters in names could not be deleted or modified
- Fix: Improvements to reading from/writing to SMB Security Settings
- Improvement: A top-level `lost+found` directory will not be shared
- Fix: In smb.conf, set `smb3 directory leases = no` to avoid issues with the current release of Samba
- Fix: Restore comments in default `/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf` files
- Fix: Windows fails to create a new folder for a share with primary=ZFS pool and secondary=EXT4 array disk
- Fix: New devices added to an existing array with valid parity should be repartitioned
- Fix: Do not spin down devices for which SMART self-test is in progress
- Fix: New array device not available for shares until the array is restarted
- Fix: ZFS allocation profile always shows one vdev only

### Networking

#### Other networking changes

- Feature: IPv6 Docker custom networks now support Unique Local Addresses (ULA) in addition to the more standard Global Unicast Addresses (GUA), assuming your router provides both subnets when the Unraid host gets an IPv6 address via DHCP or SLAAC. To use, assign a custom static IP from the appropriate subnet to the container.
- Fix: The **_Settings → Network Settings → Interface Rules_** page sometimes showed the wrong network driver (was just a display issue)

### VM Manager

- Feature: Save PCI hardware data, warn if hardware used by VM changes
- Feature: Support virtual sound cards in VMs

#### Other VM changes

- Improvement: Enhance multi-monitor support, automatically enabling spicevmc when needed
- Feature: Upgrade to noVNC v1.6
- Removed historical OpenElec and LibreElec VM templates
- Fix: VM Console did not work when user shares were disabled
- Fix: Don't allow single quotes in Domains storage path
- Fix: Change Windows 11 VM defaults
- Fix: Unable to view vdisk locations in languages other than English
- Fix: No capacity warning when editing a VM to add a 2nd vdisk
- Fix: Cdrom Bus: select IDE for i440 and SATA for q35

### Unraid API

The Unraid API is now built into Unraid! The new Notifications panel is the first major feature to use it, over time the entire webGUI will be updated to use it.

The Unraid API is fully open source: [https://github.com/unraid/api](https://github.com/unraid/api). Get started in the [API docs](../../API/index.mdx).

The Unraid Connect plugin adds functionality which communicates with our cloud servers; it remains completely optional.

#### Other Unraid API changes

- dynamix.unraid.net 4.25.3 - [see changes](https://github.com/unraid/api/releases)

### WebGUI

#### Responsive CSS

The Unraid webGUI is now responsive! Most screens should now work as well on your phone as they do on your desktop monitor.

#### Login to the webGUI via SSO

Login to the Unraid webGUI using Single Sign-On (SSO) with your Unraid.net account or any other OIDC-compliant provider. For details on this *optional* feature, see [OIDC Provider Setup](../../API/oidc-provider-setup.mdx) in the Docs.

#### Other WebGUI changes

- Feature: Add new notifications management view, access via the bell in the upper right corner of the webGUI
