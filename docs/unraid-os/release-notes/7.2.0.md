# Version 7.2.0-beta.2 2025-08-21

The Unraid webGUI is now responsive! The interface automatically adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop monitors alike. The Unraid API is now built-in, and the release also brings RAIDZ expansion, Ext2/3/4, NTFS and exFAT support, and the (optional) ability to login to the webGUI via SSO, among other features and bug fixes.

Search this page for `-beta.2` to see what has changed since the last beta.

Note that some plugins may have visual issues in this release, please give plugin authors time to make adjustments. Plugin authors, please see this post describing [how to update your plugins to make them responsive](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/192172-responsive-webgui-plugin-migration-guide/).

## Upgrading

### Known issues

#### Plugins

The Theme Engine, Dark Theme, and Dynamix Date Time plugins are incompatible and will be automatically uninstalled, as will outdated versions of Unraid Connect.

Please upgrade all plugins, particularly Unraid Connect and the Nvidia driver before updating.
Note that some plugins may have visual issues in this release, please give plugin authors time to make adjustments.

For other known issues, see the [7.1.4 release notes](7.1.4.md#known-issues).

### Rolling back

If rolling back earlier than 7.1.4, also see the [7.1.4 release notes](7.1.4.md#rolling-back).

## Changes vs. [7.1.4](7.1.4.md)

### Storage

#### ZFS RAIDZ expansion

You can now expand your single-vdev RAIDZ1/2/3 pools, one drive at a time:

- With the array running, on ***Main → Pool Devices***, select the pool name to view the details

- In the **Pool Status** area, check for an **Upgrade Pool** button. If one exists, you'll need to click that before continuing. Note that upgrading the pool will limit your ability to downgrade to earlier releases of Unraid (7.1 should be OK, but not 7.0)

- Stop the array

- On ***Main → Pool Devices***, add a slot to the pool

- Select the appropriate drive (must be at least as large as the smallest drive in the pool)

- Start the array

- Fix: There will now be an "invalid expansion" warning if the pool needs to be upgraded first \[-beta.2]

- Improvement: better defaults for ZFS RAIDZ vdevs \[-beta.2]

#### Ext2/3/4, NTFS, and exFAT Support

Unraid now supports Ext2/3/4, NTFS, and exFAT \[-beta.2] drive formats in addition to XFS, BTRFS, and ZFS.

Use case: say you are a content creator with a box full of hard drives containing all of your historical videos. When first creating an array (or after running ***Tools → New Config***), add all of your existing data drives (blank, or with data in a supported drive format) to the array.  Any parity drives will be overwritten but the data drives will retain their data. You can enjoy parity protection, share them on the network, and take full advantage of everything Unraid has to offer.

Critical note: you can continue adding filled data drives to the array up until you start the array with a parity drive installed. Once a parity drive has been added, any new data drives will be zeroed out when they are added to the array.

To clarify, Unraid has always worked this way, what is new is that Unraid now supports additional drive formats.

Additionally, you can create single drive pools using the new formats as well.

- Improved the usability of the **File System Type** dropdown as the list of available options is growing \[-beta.2]

#### Other storage changes

- Two-device ZFS pools are mirrored by default, but you can make them RAIDZ1 if you plan to expand that vdev in the future
- Fix display issue on Main page when two pools are named similarly
- Fix: [glibc bug](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/17629) which could lead to data loss with ZFS \[-beta.2]
- Improvement: Disallow shares named `homes`, `global`, and `printers` (these have special meaning in Samba) \[-beta.2]
- Fix: shares with invalid characters in names could not be deleted or modified \[-beta.2]

### Networking

#### Other networking changes

- Feature: IPv6 Docker custom networks now support Unique Local Addresses (ULA) in addition to the more standard Global Unicast Addresses (GUA), assuming your router provides both subnets when the Unraid host gets an IPv6 address via DHCP or SLAAC. To use, assign a custom static IP from the appropriate subnet to the container.
- Fix: The ***Settings → Network Settings → Interface Rules*** page sometimes showed the wrong network driver (was just a display issue)

### VM Manager

#### Other VM changes

- Feature: Save PCI hardware data, warn if hardware used by VM changes
- Feature: Support virtual sound cards in VMs
- Improvement: Enhance multi-monitor support, automatically enabling spicevmc when needed
- Feature: Upgrade to noVNC v1.6
- Removed historical OpenElec and LibreElec VM templates
- Fix: VM Console did not work when user shares were disabled
- Fix: Don't allow single quotes in Domains storage path \[-beta.2]
- Fix: Updated kernel to restore Intel Arc GPU (Xe driver) compatibility \[-beta.2]

### Unraid API

The Unraid API is now built in to Unraid! The new Notifications panel is the first major feature to use it, over time the entire webGUI will be updated to use it.

The Unraid API is fully open source: [https://github.com/unraid/api](https://github.com/unraid/api), get started building apps here [https://docs.unraid.net/API/](../../API/index.mdx).

The Unraid Connect plugin adds functionality which communicates with our cloud servers, it remains completely optional.

#### Other Unraid API changes

- dynamix.unraid.net 4.15.1 - [see changes](https://github.com/unraid/api/releases)

### WebGUI

#### Responsive CSS

The Unraid webGUI is now responsive! Most screens should now work as well on your phone as they do on your desktop monitor.

- Fix: Resolve various File Manager issues introduced with the responsive webGUI changes \[-beta.2]
- Fix: Text input fields were hidden on various pop‑ups \[-beta.2]
- Fix: Some tooltips were missing from the Main page \[-beta.2]
- Fix: Footer alignment \[-beta.2]

#### Login to the WebGUI via SSO

Login to the Unraid webGUI using Single Sign‑On (SSO) with your Unraid.net account or any other OIDC-compliant provider \[new to -beta.2]. For details on this *optional* feature, see [OIDC Provider Setup](../../API/oidc-provider-setup.mdx) in the Docs.

#### Other WebGUI changes

- Feature: Add new notifications management view, access via the bell in the upper right corner of the webGUI
- Feature: Add progress indicator to Docker / Plugin / VM popup window
- Feature: (Optional) Allow specific unraid.net accounts to login to the webGUI, see ***Settings → Management Access → Unraid API***

- Feature: Added a welcome screen for new systems, shown after setting the root password
- Fix: Re-enable smart test buttons after completion of test
- Fix: Prevent webGUI from crashing when dynamix.cfg is corrupt
- Fix: `blob:` links shouldn't be considered external
- Feature: Differentiate between Intel E-Cores and P-Cores on the Dashboard \[improved in -beta.2]
- Fix: Docker Advanced view was missing when tabs were disabled \[-beta.2]
- Fix: VPN Manager should hide key details by default \[-beta.2]

## Misc

- Feature: Do not execute `go` script when in safe mode, create `/boot/config/go.safemode` script if needed
- Improvement: Require authentication on `http://localhost`. This improves security and allows Tailscale Funnel to work with the webGUI. Note that when booting in GUI mode, you will now need to login again to access the webGUI.
- Feature: Add favicon and web app manifest support
- Feature: License key upgrades are installed automatically, without needing to restart the array
- Feature: Thunderbolt devices will be auto-authorized when connected
- Feature: Improvements to custom udev rules and scripts, at boot:

  - `/boot/config/udev/*.sh` are copied to `/etc/udev/scripts/` where they can be used by your custom udev rules
- Fix: Remove support for nonworking ipv6.hash.myunraid.net URLs
- Fix: Docker Tailscale integration was broken \[-beta.2]
- Fix: Docker custom network creation failed when IPv6 was enabled \[-beta.2]
