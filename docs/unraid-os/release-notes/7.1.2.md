# Version 7.1.2 2025-05-11

This is a small but important release, resolving a potential data-loss issue in 7.1.0 and 7.1.1 where the recent "mover empty disk" feature does not handle split levels on shares correctly.

It also resolves a smaller issue where normal mover functionality ignores split levels when moving files.
