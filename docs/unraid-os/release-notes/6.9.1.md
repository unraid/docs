## Version 6.9.1 2021-03-08

## Notable Bug Fixes and Improvements

Fixed issue where code outside the Unraid OS Management Utility calling
`smartctl` would set up conditions where devices would never spin down.
Note: you still need
[@doron](https://forums.unraid.net/profile/8006-doron/)'s [SAS
Spindown
plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/97351-plugin-spin-down-sas-drives/)
to properly support SAS device spindown.

For Docker: if an in-tree GPU driver is loaded which results in creating
`/dev/dri/*` device nodes, we set permissions for these nodes to `0777`
in order to ease integration of containers using GPU for transcoding.

Typing 'exit' in a Terminal window will now close the window (yay!).

We added a 'no-cache' header to NoVNC web access so that future Unraid
OS releases will no longer have stale web components.

Updated the openssl package to version 1.1.1j which has security
updates.

Updated the Linux kernel to 5.10.21, a patch release to 5.10 LTS kernel.

Included kernel config settings necessary to include certain hardware
monitoring devices and added support for new devices.

### Driver Updates

The Nvidia GPU driver has been updated to 460.56 and should work with
this kernel 5.10.21. Please install
[@ich777](https://forums.unraid.net/profile/72388-ich777/)'s
[Nvidia-Driver
plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/98978-plugin-nvidia-driver/) to
