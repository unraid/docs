## Version 6.11.3 2022-11-08

This release is focused on bug fixes and minor improvements.  In particular, we need to revert a base library due to a bug which
prevents formatting devices >2TB in size.

### Management

- Reverted 'libpopt.so.0.0.1' to workaround 'sgdisk' bug used to format devices larger than 2TB.
- Fixed issue where description setting for 'root' user was not preserved across reboots.
- Fix issue that sometimes information window opens empty.

- Add Nic boot order.
