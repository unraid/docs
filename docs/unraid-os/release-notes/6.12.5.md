# Version 6.12.5 2023-11-27

This release includes bug fixes and security updates.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.

### Known issues

There is a mitigation included for a [ZFS Data Corruption](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526) issue.  This is accomplished
by including this option in the default `/etc/modprobe.d/zfs.conf` file:

`zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync=0`
