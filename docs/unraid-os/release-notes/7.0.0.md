## Upgrading

When upgrading, upon first boot you may notice on Main page some of
your pool File System Types have been changed to 'auto'.  This is normal and permits a one-time update of stored pool
configuration upon array Start.  Please do not change any pool slot configuration until after the first Start.

### Known issues

If you are using ZFS pools, please take note of the following:

* You will see a warning about unsupported features in your existing ZFS pools. This is because the
version of ZFS in 7.0 is upgraded vs. 6.12 and contains new features.  This warning is harmless, meaning
your pool will still function normally.  A button will appear letting you upgrade a pool to support new
features; however, once upgraded previous versions of Unraid OS will not be able to mount the pool.
* Similarly, new pools created in 7.0 will not mount in 6.12 due to ZFS not supporting downgrades.  There is no way
around this.
* If you decide to downgrade from 7.0 to 6.12 any previously existing hybrid pools will not
be recognized upon reboot into 6.12.  To work around this, first click Tools/New Config in 7.0, preserving
all slots, then reboot into 6.12 and your hybrid pools should import correctly.
* You can define a 'spares' subpool, but if a device fails, ZFS will not automatically use one of the spares.
You could drop to the command line and do it, but this will greatly complicate pool config, ie, don't do it.
This will be fixed in a future release.
* Currently unable to import TrueNAS pools. This will be fixed in a future release.
* If you are using **Docker data-root=directory** on a ZFS volume, we recommend that you switch the
**Docker storage driver** to **overlay2**, delete the directory contents and then let Docker redownload
the image layers.
* We check that VM names do not include characters that are not valid for ZFS. Existing VMs are not modified
but will throw an error and disable update if invalid characters are found.

In -beta.3, drives may not spindown when connected to older Marvell drive controllers that use the sata_mv driver., e.g., Supermicro SASLP and SAS2LP. This may be resolved by a future kernel update.

Unraid OS v7.0 (as of -beta.3) will be released with the v6.6 LTS Linux kernel.

Please see the [6.12.10 release notes](https://docs.unraid.net/unraid-os/release-notes/6.12.10/#known-issues) for general known issues.

### Rolling back

See the warnings under **Known Issues** above.

The Dynamix File Manager, GUI Search, and Unlimited Width Plugin plugins are now built into Unraid. If you rollback to an earlier version
you will need to reinstall those plugins to retain their functionality.

If you disabled the unRAID array we recommend enabling it again before rolling back.

If you previously had Outgoing Proxies set up using the Proxy Editor plugin or some other mechanism, you will need to re-enable that mechanism after rolling back.

After rolling back, make a dummy change to each WireGuard config to get the settings appropriate for that version of Unraid.

If rolling back earlier than 6.12.10, also see the [6.12.10 release notes](https://docs.unraid.net/unraid-os/release-notes/6.12.10/#rolling-back).

## Storage

### unRAID array optional

You can now set the number of unRAID array slots to 'none'.  This will allow the array to Start without any
devices assigned to the unRAID array itself.

If you are running an all-SSD/NMVe server, we recommend assigning all devices
to one or more ZFS/BTRFS pools, since Trim/Discard is not supported with unRAID array devices.

To remove the unRAID array from an existing server, first unassign all Array slots on the Main page, and then
set the Slots to 'none'.

For new installs, the default number of slots to reserve for the unRAID array is now 'none'.

### Share secondary storage may be assigned to a pool

Shares can now be configured with pools for both primary and secondary storage, and mover will move
files between those pools.

### ReiserFS file system option has been disabled

Since ReiserFS is scheduled to be removed from the Linux kernel, the option to format a device with ReiserFS
has also been disabled.  You may use this mover function to empty an array disk prior to reformatting with
another file system, see below.  We will add a webGUI button for this in a future release.

### Using 'mover' to empty an array disk

Mover can now be used to empty an array disk. With the array started, run this at a web terminal:

```bash
mover start -e diskN |& logger &  # where N is [1..28]
```

Mover will look at each top-level director (share) and then move files one-by-one to other disks
in the array, following the usual config settings (include/exclude, split-level, alloc method). Move
targets are restricted to just the unRAID array.

Watch the syslog for status. When the mover process ends, the syslog will show a list of files which
could not be moved:

* maybe file was in-use
* maybe file is at the top-level of /mnt/diskN
* maybe we ran out of space

### Predefined shares handling

The Unraid OS Docker Manager is configured by default to use these predefined shares:

* system - used to store Docker image layers in a loopback image stored in system/docker.
* appdata - used by Docker applications to store application data.

The Unraid OS VM Manager is configured by default to use these predefined shares:

* system - used to store libvirt loopback image stored in system/libvirt
* domains - used to store VM vdisk images
* isos - used to store ISO boot images

When either Docker or VMs are enabled, the required predefined shares are created if necessary
according to these rules:

* if a pool named 'cache' is present, predefined shares are created with 'cache' as the Primary
storage with no Secondary storage.
* if no pool named 'cache' is present, the predefined shares are created with the first
alphabetically present pool as Primary with no Secondary storage.
* if no pools are present, the predefined shares are created on the unRAID array as Primary with no
Secondary storage.

### ZFS implementation

* Support Hybrid ZFS pools aka subpools
* Support recovery from multiple drive failures in a ZFS pool with sufficient protection
* Support LUKS encryption on ZFS pools and drives
* Set reasonable default profiles for new ZFS pools and subpools
* Support upgrading ZFS pools when viewing the pool status. Note: after upgrading, the volume may not be mountable in previous versions of Unraid [-beta.4]

### Allocation profiles for btrfs, zfs, and zfs subpools

When a btrfs or zfs pool/subpool is created, the default storage allocation is determined by
the number of slots (devices) initially assigned to the pool:

* for zfs main (root) pool:
  * slots == 1 => single
  * slots == 2 => mirror (1 group of 2 devices)
  * slots >= 3 => raidz1 (1 group of 'slots' devices)
* for zfs special, logs, and dedup subpools:
  * slots == 1 => single
  * slots%2 == 0 => mirror (slots/2 groups of 2 devices)
  * slots%3 == 0 => mirror (slots/3 groups of 3 devices)
  * otherwise => stripe (1 group of 'slots' devices)
* for zfs cache and spare subpools:
  * slots == 1 => single
  * slots >= 2 => stripe (1 group of 'slots' devices)

* for btrfs pools:
  * slots == 1 => single
  * slots >= 2 => raid1 (ie, what btrfs called "raid1")

There is special handling for btrfs raid1 pools and single-group zfs pools/subpools:

* For btrfs raid1 and zfs single-group mirror pools (and subpools), removing a device decreases
the pool slot count.  When/if the slot count reaches 1, a btrfs 'raid1' or zfs 'mirror' profile is changed
to 'single'.

Changing the file system type of a pool:

* For btrfs/zfs single-slot pools, the file system type can be changed at any time.

* For zfs multi-slot unformatted pool:
  * The file system type can be changed at any time except if one or more subpools have been created.
In this case, to change the file system type, you must first remove the subpool(s).
  * The pool root slot count can only be changed if the file system type is auto.  Therefore to change
the root slot count first set the file system type to auto, change the slot count, and set the file system type
back to zfs.
  * A subpool slot count can be changed however, the allocation profile will be reset to default settings
depending on the new slot count.

* For multi-slot formatted pool:
  * The root pool or any subpool slot count can be increased when Stopped in order to expand the pool.

### Other changes

* Spin up/down devices of a pool in parallel
* Add ability to change encryption phrase/keyfile for LUKS encrypted disks
* Introduce a delay between creating a GPT partition table and telling the kernel to re-read to prevent the "device or resource busy" error.

### Other changes [-beta.4]

* Fixed an issue that prevented the Main page from populating with data

## VM Manager

### Improvements

Added support for VM clones, snapshots, and evdev passthru.

## Docker

### Docker fork bomb prevention [-beta.2]

To prevent "Docker fork bombs" we introduced a new setting, ***Settings → Docker → Docker PID Limit***, which
specifies the maximum number of Process ID's which any container may have active (with default 2048).

If you have a container that requires more PID's you may either increase this setting or you may override
for a specific container by adding, for example, `--pids-limit 3000` to the Docker
template *Extra Parameters* setting.

  * Fix for 3rd party containers orange text "not available" to use the default text colour.
  * Fix: device mappings not shown correctly
  * Fix: Correctly identify/show non dockerman Managed containers
* rc.docker:
  * Fix handle interfaces with a higher index than 0
  * Only stop Unraid managed containers
  * Don't kill containers since Docker will kill them if they won't stop after the set timeout when the daemon is stopping
  * Increase timeout for daemon to die to 30 seconds (seems a bit short if 3rd party containers are installed)
  * Rephrase message for daemon to die and display it only once
  * Honor restart policy from 3rd party containers

## Networking

### Tailscale integration [-beta.3]

Unraid OS supports [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) through the use of a plugin created by Community
Developer EDACertan. When this plugin is installed, Tailscale certificates are supported for https webGUI access, and
the Tailnet URLs will be displayed on the Management Access page.

Refer to [this document](https://docs.unraid.net/unraid-os/manual/security/tailscale/) for an introduction
to using Tailscale with Unraid.

### Support iframing the webGUI [-beta.3]

Added "Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors" support to allow the webGUI to be iframed by domains it has certificates
for.  It isn't exactly supported, but additional customization is possible by using a script to modify NGINX_CUSTOMFA
in /etc/defaults/nginx

### Other changes

* Resolved issue starting Docker containers on custom IPv6 networks
* Auto-generate network.cfg at boot if one does not exist
* Added support for NFS 4.1 and 4.2
* Permit NFSv4 mounts by default

  * Add ipv6 listening address only when NetBIOS is disabled
  * Fix MacOS unable to write 'flash' share and restore Time Machine compatibility (fruit changes)
* The VPN manager now adds all interfaces to WireGuard tunnels, make a dummy change to the tunnel after
upgrading or changing network settings to update WireGuard tunnel configs.

### Other changes [-beta.3]

* Routing Table: show routes from all routing tables, not just default

## webGUI

### Integrated Dynamix File Manager plugin

Click the file manager icon and navigate through your directory structure with the ability to perform
common operations such as copy, move, delete, and rename files and directories.

### Integrated GUI Search plugin

Click the search icon on the Menu bar and type the name of the setting you are looking for.

### Outgoing Proxy Manager

If you previously used the Proxy Editor plugin or had an outgoing proxy setup for CA,
those will automatically be removed/imported. You can then adjust
them on ***Settings → Outgoing Proxy Manager***.

For more details, see the [manual](https://docs.unraid.net/unraid-os/release-notes/../manual/security/outgoing-proxy-manager/).

Note: this feature is completely unrelated to any reverse proxies you may be using.

### Notification Agents

Notification agents xml are now stored as individual xml files, making it easier to
add notification agents via plugin.

See this [sample plugin](https://github.com/Squidly271/Wxwork-sample) by @Squid

Other changes:

* fx: Agent notifications do not work if there is a problem with email notifications [-beta.3]

### NTP Configuration

For new installs, a single default NTP server is set to 'time.google.com'.

If your server is using our previous NTP defaults of `time1.google.com`, `time2.google.com` etc,
you may notice some confusing NTP-related messages in your syslog. To avoid this, consider changing
to our new defaults: navigate to ***Settings → Date & Time*** and configure **NTP server 1** to
be `time.google.com`, leaving all the others blank.

Of course, you are welcome to use any time servers you prefer, this is just to let you know that we have
tweaked our defaults.
