# Version 7.1.0-beta.1 2025-03-17

**This is BETA software. Please use on test servers only.**

This release adds wireless networking, the ability to import TrueNAS and other foreign pools, multiple enhancements to VMs, and more.

## Upgrading

### Known issues

For known issues, see the [7.0.0 release notes](7.0.0.md#known-issues).

### Rolling back

If rolling back earlier than 7.0.1, also see the [7.0.1 release notes](7.0.1.md#rolling-back).

## Changes vs. [7.0.0](7.0.0.md)

## Storage

* Import the largest partition on disk instead of the first
* Disabled disks were not shown on the dashboard

### Other changes

* Fix: Initially, only the first pool device spins down after adding a custom spin down setting.
* Fix: Removing device from btrfs raid1 or zfs single-vdev mirror will now reduce pool slot count.
* Fix: array Start was permitted if only 2 Parity devices and no Data devices
* Fix: The parity check notification often shows the previous parity check and not the current parity check.

## Networking

### Wireless Networking

Unraid now supports WiFi! A hard wired connection is typically preferred, but if that isn't possible for your situation you can now setup WiFi.

For the initial setup you will either need a local keyboard/monitor (boot into GUI mode) or a wired connection. In the future, the USB Creator will be able to configure wireless networking prior to the initial boot.

* Access the webGUI and visit ***Settings → Network Settings → Wireless wlan0***
  * First, enable WiFi
  * Find your preferred network and click the **Connect to WiFi network** icon
  * Fill in your WiFi password and other settings, then press **Join this network**

Additional details

* WPA2/WPA3 and WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise are supported
* Having both wired and wireless isn't really recommended for long term use, it should be one or the other. But if both connections use DHCP and you (un)plug a network cable while wireless is configured, the system should adjust within 45-60 seconds.
* Wireless chipset support: if your WiFi adapter can't connect to the network, please start a new forum thread and provide your diagnostics. We expect to have success with modern WiFi adapters, but we have seen an older Broadcom BCM4313 chipset fail to initialize.

### Other networking changes

* When configuring multiple network interfaces, by default the additional interfaces will have their gateway disabled, this is a safe default that works on most networks where a single gateway is required. If an additional gateway is enabled, it will be given a higher metric than existing gateways so there are no conflicts. You can override as needed.
* On ***Settings → Network Settings***, the **Desired MTU** field is disabled until you click **Enable jumbo frames**. Hover over the icon for a warning about changing the MTU, in most cases it should be left at the default setting.
* Old network interfaces are automatically removed from config files when you save changes to ***Settings → Network Settings***
* Fix various issued with DHCP

## VM Manager

### VirGL

You can now share Intel and AMD GPUs between multiple Linux VMs at the same time using VirGL, the virtual 3D OpenGL renderer. When used this way, the GPU will provide accelerated graphics but will not output on the monitor. Note that this does not yet work with Nvidia GPUs or Windows VMs.  

To use the virtual GPU in a Linux VM, edit the VM template and set the **Graphics Card** to **Virtual**. Then set the **VM Console Video Driver** to **Virtio(3d)** and select the appropriate **Render GPU** from the list of available GPUs (note that GPUs bound to VFIO-PCI or passed through to other VMs cannot be chosen here, and Nvidia GPUs are not yet supported).

### QXL Virtual GPUs

To use this feature in a VM, edit the VM template and set the **Graphics Card** to **Virtual** and the **VM Console Video Driver** to **QXL (Best)**, you can then choose how many screens it supports and how much memory to allocate to it.

### CPU Pinning is optional

CPU pinning is now optional, if no cores are pinned to a VM then the OS chooses which cores to use.

From ***Settings → CPU Settings*** or when editing a VM, press **Deselect All** to unpin all cores for this VM and set the number of vCPUs to 1, increase as needed.

### User VM Templates

To create a user template:

* Edit the VM, choose **Create Modify Template** and give it a name. It will now be stored as a **User Template**, available on the **Add VM** screen.

To use a user template:

* From the VM listing, press **Add VM**, then choose the template from the **User Templates** area.

Import/Export

* From the **Add VM** screen, hover over a user template and click the arrow to export the template to a location on the server or download it.
* On another Unraid system press **Import from file** or **Upload** to use the template.

### Other VM changes

* When the **Primary** GPU is assigned as passthrough for a VM, warn that it won't work without loading a compatible vBIOS.

## Misc

### Other changes

* The Nouveau GPU driver is now included, disabled by default as we expect most users to want the Nvidia driver instead. To enable it, uninstall the Nvidia driver plugin and run `touch /boot/config/modprobe.d/nouveau.conf` then reboot.
* On ***Settings → Date and Time*** you can now sync your clock with a **PTP** server (we expect most users will continue to use **NTP**)
* Upgraded to jQuery 3.7.1 and jQuery UI 1.14.1
* Fix: Visiting boot.php will shutdown the server
* Fix: Disabled disks don't show on the Dashboard
