# Version 7.1.1 2025-05-08

This is a small release, containing an updated version of OVMF firmware
which reverts a [commit](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/efaa102d00)
to resolve an issue that prevents certain VMs (Fedora, Debian, Rocky, other CentOS based distros)
from starting. See also [this discussion](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/issues/10883).
