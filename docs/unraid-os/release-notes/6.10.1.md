# 6.10.1

Some users boot from USB flash partition other than \"1\". That is,
instead of /dev/sda1 some users have /dev/sda2 set as volume label
UNRAID and there are even users who have no partitions at all on the
flash. In this case it boots from and mounts /dev/sda onto /boot.

A change in 6.10.0 in detecting the boot device with label UNRAID
introduced a regression where only partition 1 was considered, leaving
those users unable to complete the boot sequence.

This is fixed in 6.10.1 - and this is the only functional change in
6.10.1 vs. 6.10.0.
