## Changes vs. [7.2.0](7.2.0.md)

### webGUI

- Fix: Dashboard: Improved detection of newer Intel CPUs
- Fix: Notification Agents dropdown not working in tabbed mode

### Storage

- Improvement: When a pool's File System Type is set to 'Auto', all pool slots must be populated
- Improvement: New Config with Preserve Assignments will reduce pool slots to match the number of disks present
- Improvement: Automatically clear devices when removing from pools
- Fix: Remount dataset if 'zfs destroy' fails because dataset is busy
- Fix: If a share is created without a config file, ensure data is only stored on pools that are participating in user shares
- Fix: DeviceInfo: Only show 'Pool Device Status' section when pool is mounted
- Fix: Empty Disk feature: share data on target disk(s) now remains visible during operation, see [Converting to a new file system type](../using-unraid-to/manage-storage/file-systems.mdx#converting-to-a-new-file-system-type) for usage details.
  - Removed '-e' option from 'mover' script; use the webGUI now
- Fix: Reduce excess logging related to drive spin down and SMART self-tests

### Misc

- Fix: Improve WSD discovery on your local network (so Unraid appears in Windows Network, formerly Network Neighborhood)
  - Generate unique /boot/config/machine-id and install to /etc/machine-id on boot
  - Patch wsdd2 to work when "Host access to custom networks" is enabled
  - Note: discovery typically does not work if clients are running Tailscale
- Fix: Update 'lshw' to support LEDs on Lincstation systems
- Fix: Re-add the 'Join' Notification Agent from Unraid 6.12
- Fix: Load br_netfiltering in rc.inet1 'start' function and set default IPv4/IPv6 forwarding policy to ACCEPT (should fix Docker IPv6 issues)

### Base distro updates

- lshw: version B.02.20
