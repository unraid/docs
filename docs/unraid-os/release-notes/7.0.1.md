# Version 7.0.1 2025-02-25

## Upgrade notes

This is a security and bug fix release. It includes all the patches that were made available for 7.0.0.

This resolves a security issue when the Tailscale integration is enabled on a container running in Host mode and then shared with other users. As of this release, starting such containers has been disabled. To proceed, disable the Tailscale integration for containers in Host mode or change the Network Type to Bridge or "Custom: eth0/bond0/br0."

### Known issues

For known issues, see the [7.0.0 release notes](7.0.0.md#known-issues).

### Rolling back

If rolling back earlier than 7.0.0, also see the [7.0.0 release notes](7.0.0.md#rolling-back).
