# Version 7.0.1 (2025-02-25)

## Overview

This is a security and bug fix release. It includes all patches that were made available for 7.0.0.

This release resolves a security issue when the Tailscale integration is enabled on a container running in Host mode and then shared with other users. As of this release, starting such containers has been disabled. To proceed, disable the Tailscale integration for containers in Host mode or change the Network Type to Bridge or "Custom: eth0/bond0/br0."

---

## Key Changes

### Tailscale Docker Integration

- Prevent containers with Network Type "Host" from using the Tailscale integration; disables the ability to start existing containers in this configuration (**security**)
- Prevent new containers with Network Type "Container" from using the Tailscale integration (the sidecar container should have Tailscale, not the main container)
- Accept default Tailscale state directory from Community Apps
- Install ca_certificates if needed
- Improved handling of post arguments when the Tailscale integration is enabled; everything before the first `;` is passed to the container, everything after it is executed on the host
- **Note:** Additional enhancements are underway, specifically the ability to manage the official Tailscale sidecar container using this integration

### Docker

- Hide the update status for containers managed by 3rd parties

### File Manager

- Allow access to UD remote shares

### System Improvements & Fixes

- Increased number of sd devices detected during early boot from 8 to 16
- Resolved "Wrong Pool State," invalid expansion error seen when upgrading certain btrfs pools from 6.12
- Prevent the import of existing vfat partitions
- Resolved issue attempting to start the array with a pool defined but not assigned
- Fix `mc` not preserving cwd upon F10 exit

### Mover

- Fixed issue where mover was not moving shares with spaces in the name from array to pool
- Fixed mover not handling hard links properly

### VMs

- Fix: Cannot start/stop a VM with single quotation marks in the name
- Fix: In certain conditions, creating a VM creates a new share with the VM name
- Fix issue with blank Discard field on vDisk

### Networking

- Blacklist the cdc_ether driver to prevent issues with IPMI NICs on certain motherboards  
  To re-enable this driver, touch `/boot/config/modprobe.d/cdc_ether.conf`
- Downgrade to an earlier version of dhcpcd to try and resolve DHCP issues some users are having
