# Version 7.2.2 2025-11-21

If you are already on 7.2.1, this is an **optional** update. We primarily released it for Trial users,
to fix a bug that prevented them from seeing their Trial expiration date. We also addressed an issue related
to custom background header colors, we'd recommend updating if you have those set.

If you are on 7.2.0 or earlier you can skip straight to 7.2.2.
