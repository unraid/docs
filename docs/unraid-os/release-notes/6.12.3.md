# Version 6.12.3 2023-07-14

Changes vs. [6.12.2](6.12.2.md)

## Networking

This release has fixes for networking, particularly as it relates to IPv6. A side effect is that this will resolve an issue where the webgui won't load in certain instances.

Note: If you have code in your go script to disable IPv6, remove that and disable it via the Settings -> Network Settings page instead. Disabling IPv6 by manually running commands will cause conflicts.

## Docker

This release resolves an issue where Docker doesn't properly stop when the array stops, which can result in an unclean shutdown.

## Known Issues

Please review the known issues for [6.12.0](6.12.0#known-issues)

If Docker containers have issues starting after a while, and you are running Plex, go to your Plex Docker container settings, switch to advanced view, and add this to the Extra Params: `--no-healthcheck`
