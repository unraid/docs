## Version 6.11.5 2022-11-20

This release reverts a change which modified the wrong file. This resulted in not being able to select 'macvlan' custom
docker network type. New installations only will now have 'ipvlan' selected by default.

### Docker

- fix: Set IPVLAN as default only for new installations.
