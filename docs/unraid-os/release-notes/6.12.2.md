# Version 6.12.2 2023-06-29

Changes vs. [6.12.1](6.12.1.md)

This is mainly a bug fix release, including also a minor security update.  Other highlights:

- We reverted **docker** from v23.0.6, introduced during Unraid OS 6.12 development, to v20.10.24, which is the latest patch
release of **docker** used in Unraid OS 6.11.  This to address increased memory usage and other issues
discovered with **docker**.
- A small necessary change to invoke our 'update_services' script whenever a WireGuard tunnel starts or stops
is automatically applied to all 'config/wireguard/*.conf' files when you update via Update OS page.  For
manual update or if you downgrade, it is necessary to make a "dummy change" in a setting on the Settings/VPN Manager page and
then click Apply.
