## Version 6.11.2 2022-11-04

This release is focused on bug fixes and minor improvements. Please note there are important
security mitigations in Samba, all uses are encouraged to update.

### VM Manager

If you boot a VM from a passed physical USB device there is a new setting called **Enable USB boot** which
must be set to **Yes**. This is due to feature change in the latest OVMF component.

Changes:

- Add boot order for USB and USB Boot option. Using 'boot order' field VM can boot from
  a passed-through NVMe controller/device.
- Add virtiofs/9p Unraid share mapping.
- CD Hotplug bug fix.
- Fix Hotplug within Templates.
- Fix changing from passthru to custom CPU.
- Test for guest agent to suppress error message in libvirt log, and
  show text for guest not running or guest agent is not installed.
- Fix unable to change HyperV settings.
- Add 'start with console' option.
- OVMF for QEMU: version edk2-stable202208

### WireGuard

Changes:

- Fixed problem setting up tunnels if using default network.cfg settings.
- Fix typo setting up routes.

### Plugin manager

Changes:

- If plugin files cannot be read from CDN URL, fall back to non-CDN URL.
- Enforce plugin files must end in '.plg'.
- Fix post hook failing when plugin download fails.
- Adjust the wget parameters to keep it from indefinitely hanging.

### Scheduler

For scheduled Parity Checks, change default mode to Non-correcting. In case there are disk
issues during a parity check it would be safer to have the default be non-correct. If sync errors
are detected then the user can analyze the log and act accordingly.

### Misc. webGUI

Changes:

- DashStats: The inbound networkstats is out of place when numeric value is xxx.x.
- Docker: Add/clarify Help to Docker Custom Network settings.
- Docker: Fix display aberration on orphan images

- ShareEdit/ShareList: show pool not defined when share pool is not a defined pool
