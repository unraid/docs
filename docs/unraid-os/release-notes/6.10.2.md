### Data Corruption possible with tg3 driver when Intel VT-d is enabled

The combination of Linux 5.15 kernel, tg3 driver, and Intel VT-d enabled
appears to be causing data corruption.  This has been verified on
several platforms which include a Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet
NIC (note: there may be others).  This release includes the following
workaround:

Very early in server startup (rc.S) if Intel VT-d is detected enabled,
then the script will unconditionally create the file:

`/etc/modprobe.d/tg3.conf`

with following content:

`blacklist tg3`

Hence by default if VT-d is enabled, which is to say, it has not been
disabled in either bios or via kernel "intel*iommu=off", then we are
going to blacklist the tg3 driver on all platforms. What if someone has
a platform where tg3 does not give them any trouble with VT-d enabled?
In this case they must create an \_empty* file on their flash device:

`config/modprobe.d/tg3.conf`

When the startup sequence continues it will get to the point where it
executes:

`install -p -m 0644 /boot/config/modprobe.d/* /etc/modprobe.d`

A _blank_ tg3.conf file stored on the flash then effectively
un-blacklists it.

There will be users who will lose network connectivity because their NIC
is blacklisted. If you are running on a problematic platform you should
go into your bios and disable VT-d. If this is a platform without issue,
then you will need to create the blank tg3.conf file on your flash
config/modprobe.d directory.

It may take some time to identify and integrate a proper fix for this
issue, at which point we will remove the auto-blacklisting code.

#### How to Disable Intel VT-d on HP MicroServer Gen 8 with a E3-1265LV2

Reboot the server, then:

- During bootup press F9 to enter the bios.
- Once the bios is loaded enter the menu System Options -\> Processor
  Options -\> Intel(R) VT-d
- Set it to disabled
- Press Esc to get to the top menu again
- Press F10 to exit the bios and save

The server should now boot again as normal. Hat tip to Community member

### Security-related Changes

- The Firefox browser and has been updated to version 100.0.2 to
  address a very nasty security vulnerability.  If you use Firefox we
  also suggest upgrading on all platforms.
- We fixed an issue where webGUI login could accept a password from a
  user other than 'root', if that username included the string
  'root'.
- The Linux kernel was updated to 5.15.43 to address a "security
  bypass" vulnerability.

### Other Changes

- On Management Access page, for the "Use SSL/TLS" setting we
  changed the word "Auto" to "Strict" in the drop-down menu.  This
  better describes the action of this setting.
- Docker manager now uses Docker label for icons as fallback.
- VM manager now gives the option of using LibVirt networks in
  addition to bridges without having to edit the VM's XML.
- Improved handling of custom SSL certificates.
- [6.10.1] Fix regression: support USB flash boot from other than
  partition 1
- other misc. bug fixes
