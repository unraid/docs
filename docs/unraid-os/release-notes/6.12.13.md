# Version 6.12.13 2024-08-22

## Upgrade notes

This is a quick release that updates the Linux kernel to correct
a [regression](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/45cdf1c2-9056-4ac2-8e4d-4f07996a9267@kernel.org/T/) where some HDD devices could not
be spun-down.

For more details on recent changes, see the [6.12.12 release notes](6.12.12.md).

### Known issues

#### Windows VMs should use the VirtIO-net driver

Due to a kernel regression, there is significant performance degradation for any outgoing transfer from a Windows VM using the VirtIO network driver. The workaround is to switch to the VirtIO-net driver. (Note: this was resolved in [6.12.14](6.12.14.md)).

For other known issues, see the [6.12.12 release notes](6.12.12.md#known-issues).

### Rolling back

If rolling back earlier than 6.12.12, also see the [6.12.12 release notes](6.12.12.md#rolling-back).
