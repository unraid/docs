# Command line interface

While most tasks in Unraid can be performed through the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%, certain operations - especially those related to diagnostics, drive management, or scripting - require using the system console or %%SSH|ssh%% terminal. This page offers Unraid-specific command-line tools and examples that can be used without needing extensive Linux knowledge.

:::tip[Device paths]

Many disk-level Unraid operations depend on Linux device names, like `/dev/sdX`. You can find the device identifier for any drive in the **Main** tab of the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. Look for the three-letter label `sdX` or `nvmeX` next to each disk. Use the appropriate identifier in all commands, replacing `sdX` with your specific disk.

:::

## Accessing the terminal

Unraid includes a built-in web terminal that you can access directly from the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%. Simply use the top-right dropdown menu and select ">\_". This opens a command-line session as the %%root user|root-user%%, giving you full administrative access to your system.

You can also connect to your Unraid server externally using %%SSH|ssh%% (secure shell) with a client like %%PuTTY|putty%%.

:::tip[When should I use the terminal?]

Terminal access is useful for:

- Running diagnostics and command-line tools like `smartctl`, `xfs_repair`, `tail`, or `top`
- Executing plugin scripts or tools that don't require a user interface
- Troubleshooting issues related to connectivity, system services, or %%user shares|user-share%%

:::

### Using PuTTY (Windows only)

If you're using Windows, you might prefer %%PuTTY|putty%% for %%SSH|ssh%% access instead of the built-in terminal. It's lightweight, free, and allows you to save sessions for easy access later.

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to install and use PuTTY</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  1. Download %%PuTTY|putty%% from the [official site](https://www.putty.software/).
  2. Launch the %%PuTTY|putty%% application.
  3. Enter your Unraid server’s IP address or hostname (e.g., `tower.local`).
  4. Set the connection type to `%%SSH|ssh%%`.
  5. (Optional) Save the session name for future use.
  6. Click **Open** to start the session.
  7. When prompted, log in as `root` and then enter your password.

  Once you've logged in, you're in the Unraid shell environment. Type `exit` when you're finished to close the session.

</details>

:::note

Unraid automatically configures the SSH server on the first boot. Ensure your networking is working properly and that your root password is set before attempting a remote connection.

## Drive testing and monitoring

These tools assist with evaluating performance, checking drive health, and troubleshooting %%array|array%% slowness. All commands should be executed from the terminal or via %%SSH|ssh%%.

### `hdparm`

Use this command to test read speed and display drive characteristics.

<details>
  <summary><strong>View hdparm options</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  **Test drive read speed:**

  ```bash
  hdparm -tT /dev/sdX
  ```

  The `-t` flag tests buffered disk reads, while `-T` tests cache reads. This primarily measures sequential read performance and helps identify unusually slow drives.

  **Run multiple tests for accuracy:**

  ```bash
  for ((i=0;i<5;i++)); do hdparm -tT /dev/sdX; done
  ```

  **View drive information:**

  ```bash
  hdparm -I /dev/sdX
  ```

  This displays the model, firmware, cache size, and supported features, which helps verify disk type and controller behavior.

</details>

### `smartctl`

This command runs %%SMART|smart%% diagnostics and monitors drive health.

<details>
  <summary><strong>View smartctl options</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  **Basic %%SMART|smart%% report:**

  ```bash
  smartctl -a /dev/sdX
  ```

  If this command returns an error, try specifying the device type: `smartctl -a -d ata /dev/sdX` (use `-d nvme` for NVMe drives).

  **Start %%SMART|smart%% self-tests:**

  Short test (takes a few minutes)

  ```bash
  smartctl -t short /dev/sdX
  ```

  Extended test (may take hours)

  ```bash
  smartctl -t long /dev/sdX
  ```

  **Save %%SMART report|smart-report%% to a file:**

  ```bash
  smartctl -a /dev/sdX > /boot/smart_report.txt
  ```

  This saves the report to your Unraid flash drive for later review or sharing on the [forums](https://forums.unraid.net/).

</details>

### `diskspeed.sh`

This script allows for comprehensive surface-level performance testing with visual reports.

<details>
  <summary><strong>View diskspeed.sh usage</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  This used to be a script you would download from the Unraid forums. DiskSpeed is available now in a more refined package:

  Install DiskSpeed from [Community Applications](../../using-unraid-to/run-docker-containers/community-applications.mdx) (***Apps tab***) by searching for "DiskSpeed", or visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jbartlett777/DiskSpeed) for manual installation instructions.
