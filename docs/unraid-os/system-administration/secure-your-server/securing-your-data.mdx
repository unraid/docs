# Encrypting your data

Encrypting your drives in Unraid adds a strong layer of protection for sensitive data, helping to prevent unauthorized access if a drive is lost or stolen. Encryption is available for the %%array|array%% and the %%cache pool|cache-pool%%. However, be aware that encryption can complicate data recovery, so it should be used only when you require a specific level of data confidentiality, such as when storing sensitive personal, business, or regulated information.

:::caution

Encryption increases your data security, but can complicate recovery from hardware failure. **Only enable encryption if you have a genuine need and a reliable backup system.** If you lose your encryption key or key file, your data will be permanently inaccessible.

  <summary><strong>When should you consider encrypting your drives?</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  - You store confidential, regulated, or sensitive data on your Unraid server.
  - You are concerned about data theft if a drive is physically removed or stolen.
  - You need to comply with organizational or legal data protection requirements.

  If you use Unraid mainly for home media or non-sensitive files, encryption may not be necessary and can complicate troubleshooting and recovery.

## How to encrypt a drive in Unraid

:::warning

Encrypting a drive will erase all existing data on that drive.

:::

:::important Before encrypting

Move all data off the drive you want to encrypt to another location (another drive in your %%array|array%%, a %%cache pool|cache-pool%%, or external backup). For details on safely moving your data, see [Converting to a new file system type](../../using-unraid-to/manage-storage/file-systems.mdx#converting-to-a-new-file-system-type).

:::

To encrypt a drive:

1. Go to the **Main** tab in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.
2. Stop the %%array|array%%.
3. Select the drive you want to encrypt.
4. In **File system type**, choose the encrypted version of your desired file system (e.g., `xfs-encrypted`, `btrfs-encrypted`).
5. Click **Apply** to commit the change.
6. Click **Done** to return to the **Main** tab. The drive will now appear unmountable, and you'll have the option to format unmountable drives.
7. Double-check that you have selected the correct drive, then [format it](../../using-unraid-to/manage-storage/file-systems.mdx#creating-a-file-system-formatting) to complete the encryption setup.

After enabling encryption, you must provide the encryption key or key file each time you start the %%array|array%%. Once unlocked, encrypted drives function just like any other volume in Unraid.

## Encryption key management

Unraid requires the same encryption key or key file for all encrypted drives in your system.

- You can use a passphrase or a key file (like a random image file).
- Store your encryption key or key file in a secure, offline location. Do not rely solely on your Unraid server for key storage.
- If you lose the key or key file, your encrypted data cannot be recoveredâ€”no exceptions.

Encrypted drives use the industry-standard %%LUKS|luks%% format, which can be unlocked on any modern Linux system with the correct key.
