This method will only remove the **%%root|root-user%% password** and leave other users intact.

To reset via this method:

1. **Shut down** your Unraid server.

2. **Connect the USB flash drive** to a computer (Windows or Mac).

3. **Open the file** located at `/config/shadow` using a text editor (like Notepad++).

4. Edit the line that looks like:
   `root:$&$&%*1112233484847648DHD$%.:15477:0:99999:7:::`

   to this instead:

   `root::15477:0:99999:7:::`

5. **Save the changes** to the file and reconnect the USB drive to your server.

6. **Start your Unraid server** and set a new root password.
