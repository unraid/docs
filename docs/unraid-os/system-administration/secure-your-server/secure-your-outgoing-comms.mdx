# Secure your outgoing communications

The outgoing proxy manager and %%Tailscale|tailscale%% exit nodes provide a way to route Unraid's outgoing communications through secure channels. These tools are useful for bypassing restrictive firewalls, adhering to network policies, or safeguarding your outgoing traffic. While these solutions mainly focus on Unraid's system traffic, there are configuration options to extend their coverage to your broader network.

There are three main methods to secure your outgoing communications:

1. [**Outgoing Proxy Manager**](#setting-up-a-proxy-server) - This tool routes HTTP traffic through a proxy server, allowing you to manage and direct your web requests securely.
2. [**%%Tailscale|tailscale%% exit nodes**](#tailscale-exit-nodes) - With %%Tailscale|tailscale%% exit nodes, all your traffic can be routed through %%Tailscale|tailscale%%'s mesh network, ensuring a secure connection across your devices.
3. [**%%WireGuard|wireguard%% %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%%**](#outgoing-vpn-connections) - You can also use %%WireGuard|wireguard%% %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% to route your traffic through commercial %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% providers, adding an extra layer of privacy and security.

### Outgoing Proxy Manager vs. Tailscale/WireGuard/VPN

| Use case                                         | Recommended tool                             | Why                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bypass firewall for Unraid system updates        | Outgoing Proxy Manager                       | Routes only Unraid's system traffic through a proxy; simple and minimal configuration.                                              |
| Secure all outgoing traffic with mesh networking | %%Tailscale\|tailscale%% exit nodes          | Encrypts traffic through %%Tailscale\|tailscale%%'s mesh network; easy setup with existing %%Tailscale\|tailscale%% infrastructure. |

| Isolate Docker or VM traffic                     | %%VPN\|vpn-tunnel%% or container proxy       | Configure %%VPN\|vpn-tunnel%% at the container/VM level for granular control.                                                       |
| Access home network from anywhere                | %%Tailscale\|tailscale%% exit nodes          | Route traffic through your home network for consistent IP and geo-location.                                                         |

For most users, solutions like [%%Tailscale|tailscale%%](./tailscale.mdx) or [%%WireGuard|wireguard%%](./wireguard.mdx) are preferred for full-system security and privacy. Use Outgoing Proxy Manager when you only need to proxy Unraid's own HTTP requests.

### Setting up a proxy server

To set up a proxy server:

1. Navigate to ***Settings → Outgoing Proxy Manager*** in the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '600px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![Outgoing Proxy Manager](/img/outgoing-proxy-manager.png)
</div>

2. Add your proxy's name, URL, and (if required) username/password.
3. Click **Apply**.
4. Select your new proxy from the list and click **Apply** again.

The %%WebGUI|web-gui%% will automatically use the selected proxy for outgoing system traffic. If you have open web terminals or %%SSH|ssh%% sessions, close and reopen them to apply the new proxy settings. This usage is transparent—monitor proxy server logs to verify activity.

### Choosing an HTTP proxy server

- **If your organization provides a proxy:** Use the address and credentials supplied by your network administrator.
- **If you need to set up your own:**
  - The [Proxy Server Docker container by @ich777](https://forums.unraid.net/profile/72388-ich777/) is tested and works well with Unraid.
  - You can configure this container to route traffic through a commercial %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% using Unraid's [%%WireGuard|wireguard%% %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%%](wireguard.mdx) or connect it to another Docker-based %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% service.
  - For reliability, host the proxy server on a separate system from Unraid to ensure network availability during boot.

To monitor proxy traffic, go to the **Docker** tab on the proxy host system, select the **Proxy Server** container, and view **Logs**.

### Automatic import and plugin compatibility

- If you previously used the **Proxy Editor** plugin, it will be automatically removed upon upgrading to Unraid 7.0+ with built-in proxy support.
- Legacy proxy settings in your `config/go` script or in `community.applications/proxy.cfg` will be imported automatically, and the old files will be renamed for safety.

### Plugin compatibility

- Plugins using PHP’s `curl_init()` function will automatically use the outgoing proxy.
- Plugins using `file_get_contents()` should migrate to `curl_init()` for proxy compatibility.
- For command-line processes, prefer `curl` over `wget` for proxy support.

For additional information about plugin development and compatibility, visit the [Plugins section of the documentation](../../using-unraid-to/customize-your-experience/plugins.mdx).

## Tailscale exit nodes

%%Tailscale|tailscale%% exit nodes offer a secure and modern way to route your Unraid server's outgoing traffic through another device on your %%Tailnet|tailnet%%. This setup provides the security of a %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% while leveraging %%Tailscale|tailscale%%'s easy-to-use mesh networking, making it ideal for users who want encrypted outgoing traffic without the complexity of traditional %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%%s.

:::tip When to use Tailscale exit nodes

Consider using %%Tailscale|tailscale%% exit nodes for:

- Securing outgoing traffic from your home network while traveling
- Maintaining consistent IP addresses for services that block VPN traffic
- Integrating seamlessly with existing %%Tailscale|tailscale%% infrastructure

:::

### Configuring Tailscale exit nodes

To set up a %%Tailscale|tailscale%% exit node for your server's outgoing traffic:

1. **Install the [Tailscale plugin](https://unraid.net/community/apps/c/plugins?q=tailscale#r:~:text=Plugins-,Tailscale%20\(Plugin\),-Derek%20Kaser)** from Community Applications if it’s not already installed.
2. **Set up an exit node** on your %%Tailnet|tailnet%%. This can be another Unraid server, a Docker container, or any device running %%Tailscale|tailscale%%.
3. **Configure your Unraid server** to use the exit node:
   - Navigate to ***Settings → Tailscale***.
   - In the **Use Exit Node** field, select your available exit node.
   - Click **Apply**.

### Mullvad integration

Tailscale has teamed up with Mullvad VPN to provide commercial exit nodes. You can purchase [Mullvad VPN through Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/mullvad), gaining access to their global network of servers as exit nodes. This combination offers Tailscale's mesh networking along with Mullvad's privacy-focused infrastructure.

### Docker container exit nodes

You can also set up a Docker container to function as a %%Tailscale|tailscale%% exit node on your Unraid server.

1. **Deploy a %%Tailscale|tailscale%% container** using the [official %%Tailscale|tailscale%% Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tailscale/tailscale).
2. **Configure the container** by adding the `--advertise-exit-node` flag.
3. **Approve the exit node** in your %%Tailscale|tailscale%% admin console.
4. **Select the container** as an exit node for your other devices on the %%Tailnet|tailnet%%.

## Outgoing VPN connections

Unraid supports outgoing WireGuard VPN connections to commercial providers, allowing you to route Docker containers or your entire server’s traffic through a secure tunnel. This is useful for privacy, bypassing geo-restrictions, or securing outbound data. For community insights and troubleshooting, see the [WireGuard VPN tunneled access forum thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/84316-wireguard-vpn-tunneled-access/).

:::tip
Choose a provider with native %%WireGuard|wireguard%% support and strong privacy policies. Avoid providers that require custom clients or proprietary protocols.
:::

### Configuring VPN tunneled access for Docker

You can route specific Docker containers through a commercial %%VPN|vpn-tunnel%% tunnel - no router changes required.

1. Download the %%WireGuard|wireguard%% config file from your chosen provider.
2. In ***Settings → VPN Manager***, select **Import Config** and upload the file. This creates a new tunnel.
3. The **Peer type of access** defaults to *VPN tunneled access for Docker*. Optionally, give it a local name.
4. Click **Apply**.
5. Set the tunnel toggle to **Active**.

:::tip
Note the tunnel name (e.g., `wg0`, `wg1`, `wg2`). You’ll need it when configuring Docker containers.\
If your provider specifies a DNS server in their config, record it for later use. If not, use a public DNS like `8.8.8.8`.
:::

### Testing the Docker tunnel

To verify your Docker tunnel is working and not leaking DNS or IP information:

1. Install a [Firefox](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=Firefox) Docker container via Community Applications.
2. Set its **Network Type** to **Custom: wgX** (replace X with your tunnel name).
3. Switch to **Advanced** view and add your DNS provider to **Extra Parameters** (e.g., `--dns=8.8.8.8`).
4. Apply changes and start the container.
5. Launch Firefox and visit [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) to verify your IP address matches the VPN server’s country.
6. Visit [dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) and confirm only your VPN’s DNS servers are detected.

You can assign additional containers to this tunnel or create multiple tunnels.

### Configuring VPN tunneled access for the system

To route all Unraid traffic through a commercial VPN:

1. Download the %%WireGuard|wireguard%% config from your provider.
2. In ***Settings → VPN Manager***, select **Import Config** and upload the file.
3. Optionally, rename the tunnel.
4. Click **Apply**.
5. Set the tunnel toggle to **Active**.

:::note

- You may need to disable the tunnel temporarily for Unraid updates or plugin installations.
- Only one system-wide tunnel can be active at a time.
- Unraid ignores DNS settings from the imported config. Set Unraid’s DNS to a reliable public server (e.g., `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`).

:::

### Testing the system tunnel

1. Install the [Firefox](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=Firefox) Docker container.
2. Accept all defaults.
3. Launch Firefox and visit [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). Your IP address should match your VPN provider’s location.
