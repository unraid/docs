## Controlling access to shared folders

### Choosing a network file sharing protocol

When sharing files with your Unraid server over your home or office network, you have some choices about how to connect. Unraid supports popular methods, known as communication protocols, that help devices talk to each other.

| Protocol                  | Primary Use                         | Key Advantages                                                                 | Key Disadvantages                                                      | Recommended Use Cases                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| SMB (Server Message Block)| Native Windows/macOS integration    | Built-in Windows support; supports printers and VM storage; fast with large files | Older versions (SMBv1) insecure; slower with small files               | Windows and Mac networks; mixed resource environments (printers, VMs) |
| NFS (Network File System) | Native Unix/Linux integration       | Optimized for Linux/Unix; efficient with small files; low overhead            | Requires extra tools for Windows; network reliability critical; limited locking | Linux and Unix environments; small file operations; static data workloads |
| FTP (File Transfer Protocol)| Cross-platform compatibility      | Works via browsers and clients; simple setup; batch file transfers            | No encryption (plaintext authentication); no integrity checks; outdated security model | Non-sensitive data; legacy systems; quick cross-OS transfers |

:::important

Starting with Unraid version 6.9, support for **AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)** has been removed. To ensure that your Mac computers work well with your Unraid server, including features like Time Machine backups, go to ***Settings > SMB*** and turn on **Enhanced macOS interoperability**.
:::

Deciding which protocol to use depends on the types of devices you have and what you need to do with your files. By default, Unraid enables SMB because it's widely supported by modern Windows and macOS systems. NFS and FTP are turned off but can be enabled if needed.

For instance, if you use an FTP client to connect to your Unraid server, you can easily transfer large files and even pause and resume your uploads or downloads if needed.

### Managing network visibility of shares

You can set up different access permissions for your network folders (shares) in Unraid by: 

1. **Go to the Shares Tab**: Start by clicking on the **Shares** tab in the WebGUI.

2. **Select a Share**: Choose an existing share that you want to adjust.

3. **Scroll to Security Settings**: At the bottom of the share settings page, you’ll see a section for security options for each network protocol that is enabled.

4. **Adjust the Export Setting**: This setting controls how the share appears on the network. You have three options:

   - **Yes**: The share is visible and anyone browsing the network can access it.
   - **Yes (Hidden)**: The share won’t show up in the network browse lists, but if someone knows the name of the share, they can still access it.
   - **No**: The share is completely hidden and not accessible through that specific protocol.

By tweaking these options, you can manage who can see and access each share, making it easier to keep everything secure while ensuring the right people have the access they need, whether they are using SMB, NFS, or FTP connections.

### Setting user permissions for shares

Share security controls how users access shared files on your system. You can set up a share to require a username and password for accessing files, limit access to read-only, or make it completely public with no credentials needed.

:::note Example

If you create a `movies` share on your Unraid server, you can choose whether to require a valid username and password just for reading data or allow public access. If you need to add users, a `root` user can create share users by following the process in **Creating a User in Unraid**.
:::

When you go to the **Shares** tab and select a share, you’ll see its settings, including a security section where you can manage [access permissions](#configuring-share-visibility) based on the protocols you have enabled. This way, you can tailor who has access to your files depending on their needs.

The **Security** setting has the following options:

| Type       | Explanation                                                     | Common Use Case                                                |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public** | Open access: Everyone can read and write to this folder.       | Suitable for non-sensitive information, like shared media or public downloads. |
| **Secure** | Limited access: Everyone can read, but only certain users can write. | Good for shared projects where collaboration is needed, like team folders. |
| **Private**| Restricted access: Only specific users can read or write.      | Ideal for sensitive information, such as financial records or personal documents. |

:::caution The Windows ‘Gotcha’

When using Windows to access network shares, there's a key issue to be aware of: Windows can only use one set of login details for each server at a time. If you try to connect to different shares on the same server that require different logins (and those shares are not public), the connection will fail.

Here’s What You Should Do:  
1. **Connect to private or secure shares first**: If you have any shares on the server that are marked as *Private* or *Secure*, make sure you connect to those first. 
   
2. **Then connect to public shares**: After connecting to the private or secure shares, you can then access any shares set to *Public*.

Workaround:  

If you encounter issues, you can connect to the server using either its network name or its IP address. Windows treats these as different servers, which can help bypass the login restriction.
