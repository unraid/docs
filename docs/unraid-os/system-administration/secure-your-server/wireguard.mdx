# WireGuard

While Tailscale provides a user-friendly experience for most, [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is a robust built-in VPN solution in Unraid that shines in specific advanced networking scenarios. It’s particularly useful when you need detailed control over VPN routing or require server-to-server or LAN-to-LAN connections without relying on third-party services. Below are key scenarios where WireGuard excels.

<h4>When to choose WireGuard</h4>

| Scenario                      | Why choose %%WireGuard\|wireguard%%?                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advanced configuration**    | Allows for custom %%VPN Tunnel\|vpn-tunnel%% setups and integration with existing network infrastructure |
| **Server-to-server tunnels**  | Lets you create persistent encrypted links between Unraid servers                                        |
| **LAN-to-LAN integration**    | Connects entire networks without involving intermediary services                                         |
| **Bandwidth-intensive tasks** | Offers minimal protocol overhead for maximum throughput                                                  |

:::info

For most users, [**Tailscale**](../secure-your-server/tailscale.mdx) can accomplish everything that WireGuard can do, often more easily. It typically doesn’t require port forwarding or manual configuration. However, if you need advanced, custom VPN setups or have specific compatibility requirements, choosing WireGuard may be a better option for some.

## Setting up WireGuard on Unraid

:::note Prerequisites

- **Dynamic DNS:** Set up DDNS for reliable access if your public IP changes. Popular options include [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (requires domain ownership), [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/), or [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) (free but may experience occasional outages).
- **Router configuration:**
  - Enable %%UPnP|upnp%% in ***Settings → Management Access*** for automatic port forwarding.
  - If %%UPnP|upnp%% is unavailable, manually forward UDP port 51820 to your Unraid server's IP.
- **Client software:** Install %%WireGuard|wireguard%% on your devices ([Windows](https://www.wireguard.com/install/), [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android)).

<h4>Step 1: Generate keys</h4>

1. Go to ***Settings → VPN Manager***.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '600px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![VPN Manager](/img/wg0.png)
</div>

2. Name your tunnel (e.g., "Home VPN").
3. Click **Generate Keypair** to create public/private keys.

:::warning

Store the private key securely since it provides full network access.\\

:::

<h4>Step 2: Configure your endpoint</h4>

- **For DDNS users:** Replace the IP in **Local endpoint** with your DDNS URL (e.g., `myhome.duckdns.org`).
- Keep the default port (`51820`) unless it conflicts with existing services.

<h4>Step 3: Set up port forwarding</h4>

- **%%UPnP|upnp%% users:** Unraid will automatically forward ports if enabled in ***Settings → Management Access***.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '600px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![UPnP enabled](/img/upnp-yes.png)
</div>

- **Manual setup:** If %%UPnP|upnp%% is unavailable:
  1. Log into your router.
  2. Forward UDP port `51820` to your Unraid server's LAN IP.
  3. Use the same port for external and internal settings.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '600px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![UPnP disabled](/img/upnp-no.png)
</div>

<h4>Step 4: Activate your tunnel</h4>

1. Toggle **Active** to enable %%WireGuard|wireguard%%.
2. Enable **Autostart** to run %%WireGuard|wireguard%% at boot.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '600px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![Activation toggle](/img/activate.png)
</div>

:::important Security best practices

- **Trusted access only:** VPN access is similar to physical network access, so only authorize trusted devices.
- **Key management:** Never share private keys; treat them like passwords.
- **Network segmentation:** For complex setups (custom Docker/%%VM|vm%%s), isolate VPN traffic using VLANs or separate subnets.
- **Regular audits:** Review connected devices and access permissions quarterly.

:::

### Defining a peer (client)

A peer is a client device - such as a phone, laptop, or another server - that connects to your Unraid %%WireGuard|wireguard%% VPN. Defining a peer means creating a unique identity and securing keys for that device.

1. Select **Add Peer**.

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '600px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  ![Add Peer](/img/peer-add.png)
</div>

2. Name the peer (e.g., *MyAndroid*).
3. Choose the initial connection type for full network access, typically *Remote access to LAN*.
4. Click **Generate Keypair** to create public and private keys. Keep the private key secure.
5. Optionally, generate a preshared key for extra security.
6. Click **Apply**.

:::note

While peers can generate their own keys, letting Unraid generate keys simplifies setup by providing complete config files.

:::

:::caution

Adding a new peer can temporarily disable the %%WireGuard|wireguard%% tunnel, which may interrupt your connection. Ensure you have local access to your server before making changes.

:::

### Configuring a peer (client)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mobile" label="Mobile device" default>

    1. Select the eye ![Peer configuration](/img/eye-icon.png) icon to view the peer configuration.

    <div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '600px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      ![Peer configuration](/img/peer-eye.png)
    </div>

    2. In the %%WireGuard|wireguard%% mobile app, choose **Create from QR code** and scan the QR code.
    3. Name the connection and connect. The %%VPN tunnel|vpn-tunnel%% should start quickly.
    4. Keep the QR code private - anyone with it can access your VPN.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="other" label="Other devices">

    1. Select the eye ![Peer configuration](/img/eye-icon.png) icon to view the peer configuration.

    <div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '600px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      ![Peer configuration](/img/peer-eye.png)
    </div>

    2. Download the configuration file.
    3. Securely transfer it to the client device (e.g., via trusted email or cloud storage).
    4. Unzip and import the configuration into the %%WireGuard|wireguard%% client.
    5. Protect this file to prevent unauthorized VPN access.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configuring your DNS

1. Access devices using IP addresses or fully qualified domain names (e.g., `yourpersonalhash.unraid.net`).

:::note

Short names like "tower" or router-managed DNS entries may not work over the VPN.

:::

2. To enable short name resolution:
   - Go to ***Settings → VPN Manager*** in Unraid.
   - Switch from **Basic** to **Advanced** mode.
   - Enter the IP address of your preferred DNS server in the **Peer DNS Server** field.
   - Save changes and update the client configuration file.
3. Recommended DNS servers:
   - Your LAN router’s IP address.
   - Public DNS servers like `8.8.8.8`.

This setup is especially important for **Remote tunneled access** mode, where the client’s original DNS server may be inaccessible.

:::note

%%mDNS|mdns%% addresses (e.g., `tower.local`) only work on the local network and not over %%WireGuard|wireguard%% VPN.

:::

### Complex networks

For most users, the default **Use NAT** setting works out of the box and allows access to Unraid and most LAN devices. However, if you use Docker containers with custom IPs or %%VM|vm%%s with strict networking requirements:

1. In your %%WireGuard|wireguard%% tunnel configuration, set **Use NAT** to **No**.
2. On your router, add a static route for the WireGuard tunnel network (e.g., `10.253.0.0/24`) pointing to your Unraid server’s IP.
3. In ***Settings → Docker Settings***, set **Host access to custom networks** to **Enabled**.

### Configurations to avoid

| Use NAT setting | Host access to custom networks   | Server & Dockers (Bridge/Host) | %%VMs\|vm%% & other LAN systems | Dockers with custom IP | Notes                                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Yes             | Disabled (Static route optional) | Accessible                     | Accessible                      | Not accessible         | Simple network setup; recommended for most users      |
| Yes             | Enabled (Static route optional)  | Accessible                     | Not accessible                  | Not accessible         | Avoid this configuration                              |
| No              | Disabled (No static route)       | Accessible                     | Not accessible                  | Not accessible         | Avoid; requires static route to function properly     |
| No              | Disabled (With static route)     | Accessible                     | Accessible                      | Not accessible         | Almost correct; enable host access to custom networks |
| No              | Enabled (With static route)      | Accessible                     | Accessible                      | Accessible             | Recommended setup for complex networks                |

## Troubleshooting WireGuard

WireGuard is designed to be unobtrusive - if something isn’t working, it won’t provide error messages. To troubleshoot effectively, you should systematically check each aspect of your setup.

#### Connection checklist

- ✅ The tunnel is active on both Unraid and client devices. *("Active" means the tunnel has started but is not necessarily connected.)*
- ✅ DDNS URL points to your current public IP and is set in **Local endpoint**.
- ✅ Correct UDP port is forwarded from your router to Unraid, matching the **Local endpoint** port.
- ✅ Clients have the latest configuration files after any server-side changes.
- ✅ Changes are saved before viewing or distributing peer configs (QR codes/files).

#### Additional troubleshooting ideas

  <summary><strong>First-time setup tips</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  If you’re setting up WireGuard for the first time, these tips can help you avoid common pitfalls:

  - Set up your first client using a mobile device on cellular data (not Wi-Fi) to rule out local network issues.
  - Use the QR code method for the easiest configuration transfer.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Handshake and connectivity issues</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  If you’re not seeing a handshake or can’t connect, try these targeted checks:

  - If you don’t see a handshake, try generating traffic (for example, pinging the server) to trigger the connection.
  - Disable energy-saving, data saver, or battery saver features on mobile clients, as these may interfere with VPN operation.
  - Ensure that the client and server networks use different subnets (for example, avoid both using `192.168.1.0/24`).
  - If using Cloudflare for DDNS, set **Proxy status** to **DNS only** (not **Proxied**). Allow time for DNS changes to propagate.
  - If you can connect from some locations but not others, the remote network may block UDP traffic. %%WireGuard|wireguard%% currently does not support TCP as a fallback.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Advanced network conflicts</strong> - Click to expand/collapse</summary>

  If your network setup is more complex, or you suspect an IP conflict, review these advanced troubleshooting steps:

  - In **Advanced** mode, confirm that your **Local tunnel network pool** does not overlap with any existing network on either side. If there’s a conflict, change to a different private subnet (for example, `10.10.10.0/24`).
  - For Docker containers with custom IPs or %%VM|vm%%s with strict requirements, see the [Complex networks](#complex-networks) section.
