_THIS SECTION IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

Even though unRaid is based at its core on a Linux distribution it does
not support the standard set of user facilities available on most Linux
systems. Instead the users defined in unRaid can be divided into:

- Admin user:
- Share permissions Users:
- Other Users:

# Admin User (root)

# Share permissions Users

# Other Users
