# Users

*THIS SECTION IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

Even though unRaid is based at its core on a Linux distribution it does
not support the standard set of user facilities available on most Linux
systems. Instead the users defined in unRaid can be divided into:

-   Admin user:
-   Share permissions Users:
-   Other Users:

# Admin User (root) {#admin_user_root}

# Share permissions Users {#share_permissions_users}

# Other Users {#other_users}
