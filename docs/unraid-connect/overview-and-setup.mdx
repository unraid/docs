## Data collection and privacy

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to see what data is collected and how we handle it</strong></summary>

  Unraid Connect prioritizes your privacy and transparency. Here’s what you need to know about how we handle your data:

  <h3>What data is collected and why</h3>

  When your server connects to Unraid.net, it establishes a secure connection to our infrastructure and transmits only the necessary data required for a seamless experience in the Unraid Connect Dashboard. This includes:

  - Server hostname, description, and icon
  - Keyfile details and flash %%GUID|guid%%
  - Local access URL and LAN IP (only if a certificate is installed)
  - Remote access URL and WAN IP (if remote access is turned on)
  - Installed Unraid version and uptime
  - Unraid Connect plugin version and unraid-api version/uptime
  - %%Array|array%% size and usage (only numbers, no file specifics)
  - Number of Docker containers and %%VMs|vm%% installed and running

  We use this data solely to enable Unraid Connect features, such as remote monitoring, management, and notifications. It is not used for advertising or profiling.

  <h3>Data retention policy</h3>

  - We only keep the most recent update from your server; no past data is stored.
  - Data is retained as long as your server is registered and using Unraid Connect.
  - To delete your data, simply uninstall the plugin and remove any %%SSL|ssl%% certificates issued through Let's Encrypt.

  <h3>Data sharing</h3>

  - Your data is **not shared with third parties** unless it is necessary for Unraid Connect services, such as certificate provisioning through Let's Encrypt.
  - We do not collect or share any user content, file details, or personal information beyond what is specified above.

  For more details, check out our [Policies](https://unraid.net/policies) page.

## Signing out

You can sign out of Unraid Connect anytime from ***Settings → Management Access → Unraid Connect → Account Status*** by clicking the **Sign Out** button.

When you sign out:

- Your server remains listed on the Connect dashboard, but you lose access to remote management features.
- Remote access, cloud-based flash backups, and other Unraid Connect features will be disabled for that server.
- You can still download your registration keys, but you cannot manage or monitor the server remotely until you sign in again.
- Signing out does **not** disconnect your server from the local network or affect local access.

---

## Uninstalling the plugin

When you uninstall the Unraid Connect plugin:

- All flash backup files will be deactivated and deleted from your local flash drive.
- Cloud backups are marked for removal from Unraid servers; they will be retained for 30 days, after which they are permanently purged. For immediate deletion, [disable Flash Backup](./automated-flash-backup.mdx) before uninstalling.
- Remote access will be disabled. Ensure that you remove any related port forwarding rules from your router.
- Your server will be signed out of Unraid.net.

:::note

Uninstalling the plugin does **not** revert your server's URL from `https://yourpersonalhash.unraid.net` to `http://computername`. If you wish to change your access URL, refer to [Disabling SSL for local access](../unraid-os/system-administration/secure-your-server/securing-your-connection.mdx#disabling-ssl-for-local-access).

```
unraid-api restart
```
