# OIDC Provider Setup

This guide walks you through configuring OIDC (OpenID Connect) providers for SSO authentication in the Unraid API using the web interface.

## Accessing OIDC Settings

1. Navigate to your Unraid server's web interface
2. The OIDC Providers section is available on the main configuration page
3. You'll see tabs for different providers - click the **+** button to add a new provider

### OIDC Providers Interface Overview

![Login Page with SSO Options](/img/api/sso-with-options.png)
*Login page showing traditional login form with SSO options - "Login With Unraid.net" and "Sign in with Google" buttons*

The interface includes:

- **Provider tabs**: Each configured provider (Unraid.net, Google, etc.) appears as a tab
- **Add Provider button**: Click the **+** button to add new providers
- **Authorization Mode dropdown**: Toggle between "simple" and "advanced" modes
- **Simple Authorization section**: Configure allowed email domains and specific addresses
- **Add Item buttons**: Click to add multiple authorization rules

## Understanding Authorization Modes

The interface provides two authorization modes:

### Simple Mode (Recommended)

Simple mode is the easiest way to configure authorization. You can:

- Allow specific email domains (e.g., @company.com)
- Allow specific email addresses
- Configure who can access your Unraid server with minimal setup

**When to use Simple Mode:**

- You want to allow all users from your company domain
- You have a small list of specific users
- You're new to OIDC configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced Mode</strong></summary>

Advanced mode provides granular control using claim-based rules. You can:

- Create complex authorization rules based on JWT claims
- Use operators like equals, contains, endsWith, startsWith
- Combine multiple conditions with OR/AND logic
- Choose whether ANY rule must pass (OR mode) or ALL rules must pass (AND mode)

**When to use Advanced Mode:**

- You need to check group memberships
- You want to verify multiple claims (e.g., email domain AND verified status)
- You have complex authorization requirements
- You need fine-grained control over how rules are evaluated

</details>

## Authorization Rules

### Simple Mode Examples

#### Allow Company Domain

In Simple Authorization:

- **Allowed Email Domains**: Enter `company.com`
- This allows anyone with @company.com email

#### Allow Specific Users

- **Specific Email Addresses**: Add individual emails
- Click **Add Item** to add multiple addresses

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced Mode Examples</strong></summary>

#### Authorization Rule Mode

When using multiple rules, you can choose how they're evaluated:

- **OR Mode** (default): User is authorized if ANY rule passes
- **AND Mode**: User is authorized only if ALL rules pass

#### Email Domain with Verification (AND Mode)

To require both email domain AND verification:

1. Set **Authorization Rule Mode** to `AND`
2. Add two rules:
   - Rule 1:
     - **Claim**: `email`
     - **Operator**: `endsWith`
     - **Value**: `@company.com`
   - Rule 2:
     - **Claim**: `email_verified`
     - **Operator**: `equals`
     - **Value**: `true`

This ensures users must have both a company email AND a verified email address.

#### Group-Based Access (OR Mode)

To allow access to multiple groups:

1. Set **Authorization Rule Mode** to `OR` (default)
2. Add rules for each group:
   - **Claim**: `groups`
   - **Operator**: `contains`
   - **Value**: `admins`
   
   Or add another rule:
   - **Claim**: `groups`
   - **Operator**: `contains`
   - **Value**: `developers`

Users in either `admins` OR `developers` group will be authorized.

#### Multiple Domains

- **Claim**: `email`
- **Operator**: `endsWith`
- **Values**: Add multiple domains (e.g., `company.com`, `subsidiary.com`)

#### Complex Authorization (AND Mode)

For strict security requiring multiple conditions:

1. Set **Authorization Rule Mode** to `AND`
2. Add multiple rules that ALL must pass:
   - Email must be from company domain
   - Email must be verified
   - User must be in specific group
   - Account must have 2FA enabled (if claim available)

### Provider Tabs

- Each configured provider appears as a tab at the top
- Click a tab to switch between provider configurations
- The **+** button on the right adds a new provider

### Authorization Mode Dropdown

- **simple**: Best for email-based authorization (recommended for most users)
- **advanced**: For complex claim-based rules using JWT claims

### Simple Authorization Fields

When "simple" mode is selected, you'll see:

- **Allowed Email Domains**: Enter domains without @ (e.g., `company.com`)
    - Helper text: "Users with emails ending in these domains can login"
- **Specific Email Addresses**: Add individual email addresses
    - Helper text: "Only these exact email addresses can login"
- **Add Item** buttons to add multiple entries

### Advanced Authorization Fields

When "advanced" mode is selected, you'll see:

- **Authorization Rule Mode**: Choose `OR` (any rule passes) or `AND` (all rules must pass)
- **Authorization Rules**: Add multiple claim-based rules
- **For each rule**:
    - **Claim**: The JWT claim to check
    - **Operator**: How to compare (equals, contains, endsWith, startsWith)
    - **Value**: What to match against

### Additional Interface Elements

- **Enable Developer Sandbox**: Toggle to enable GraphQL sandbox at `/graphql`
- The interface uses a dark theme for better visibility
- Field validation indicators help ensure correct configuration

</details>

### Required Redirect URI

All providers must be configured with this redirect URI:

```
http://YOUR_UNRAID_IP/graphql/api/auth/oidc/callback
```

Replace `YOUR_UNRAID_IP` with your actual server IP address.

### Issuer URL Format

The **Issuer URL** field accepts both formats, but **base URL is strongly recommended** for security:

- **Base URL** (recommended): `https://accounts.google.com`
- **Full discovery URL**: `https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

**⚠️ Security Note**: Always use the base URL format when possible. The system automatically appends `/.well-known/openid-configuration` for OIDC discovery. Using the full discovery URL directly disables important issuer validation checks and is not recommended by the OpenID Connect specification.

**Examples of correct base URLs:**
- Google: `https://accounts.google.com`
- Microsoft/Azure: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/v2.0`
- Keycloak: `https://keycloak.example.com/realms/YOUR_REALM`
- Authelia: `https://auth.yourdomain.com`

## Testing Your Configuration

![Login Page with SSO Buttons](/img/api/sso-with-options.png)
*Unraid login page displaying both traditional username/password authentication and SSO options with customized provider buttons*

1. Save your provider configuration
2. Log out (if logged in)
3. Navigate to the login page
4. Your configured provider button should appear
5. Click to test the login flow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Provider not found" error

- Ensure the Issuer URL is correct
- Check that the provider supports OIDC discovery (/.well-known/openid-configuration)

#### "Authorization failed"

- In Simple Mode: Check email domains are entered correctly (without @)
- In Advanced Mode: 
  - Verify claim names match exactly what your provider sends
  - Check if Authorization Rule Mode is set correctly (OR vs AND)
  - Ensure all required claims are present in the token
- Enable debug logging to see actual claims and rule evaluation

#### "Invalid redirect URI"

- Ensure the redirect URI in your provider matches exactly
- Include the correct port if using a non-standard configuration
- Use HTTP for local, HTTPS for production

#### Cannot see login button

- Check that at least one authorization rule is configured
- Verify the provider is enabled/saved

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues:

1. Enable debug logging:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug unraid-api start --debug
```

2. Check logs for:

- Received claims from provider
- Authorization rule evaluation
- Token validation errors

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always use HTTPS in production** - OAuth requires secure connections
2. **Use Simple Mode for authorization** - Prevents overly accepting configurations and reduces misconfiguration risks
3. **Be specific with authorization** - Don't use overly broad rules
4. **Rotate secrets regularly** - Update client secrets periodically
5. **Test thoroughly** - Verify only intended users can access

## Need Help?

- Check provider's OIDC documentation
- Review Unraid API logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure your provider supports standard OIDC discovery
- Verify network connectivity between Unraid and provider

## Provider-Specific Setup

### Unraid.net Provider

The Unraid.net provider is built-in and pre-configured. You only need to configure authorization rules in the interface.

**Configuration:**
- **Issuer URL**: Pre-configured (built-in provider)
- **Client ID/Secret**: Pre-configured (built-in provider)
- **Redirect URI**: `http://YOUR_UNRAID_IP/graphql/api/auth/oidc/callback`

:::warning[Security Notice]
**Always use HTTPS for production redirect URIs!** The examples above use HTTP for initial setup and testing only. In production environments, you MUST use HTTPS (e.g., `https://YOUR_UNRAID_IP/graphql/api/auth/oidc/callback`) to ensure secure communication and prevent credential interception. Most OIDC providers will reject HTTP redirect URIs for security reasons.
:::

Configure authorization rules using Simple Mode (allowed email domains/addresses) or Advanced Mode for complex requirements.

### Google

Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/):

1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials** → **OAuth client ID**
3. Choose **Web application** as the application type
4. Add your redirect URI to **Authorized redirect URIs**
5. Configure the OAuth consent screen if prompted

**Configuration:**

- **Issuer URL**: `https://accounts.google.com`
- **Client ID/Secret**: From your OAuth 2.0 client credentials
- **Required Scopes**: `openid`, `profile`, `email`
- **Redirect URI**: `http://YOUR_UNRAID_IP/graphql/api/auth/oidc/callback`

:::warning[Google Domain Requirements]
**Google requires valid domain names for OAuth redirect URIs.** Local IP addresses and `.local` domains are not accepted. To use Google OAuth with your Unraid server, you'll need:

- **Option 1: Reverse Proxy** - Set up a reverse proxy (like NGINX Proxy Manager or Traefik) with a valid domain name pointing to your Unraid API
- **Option 2: Tailscale** - Use Tailscale to get a valid `*.ts.net` domain that Google will accept
- **Option 3: Dynamic DNS** - Use a DDNS service to get a public domain name for your server

Remember to update your redirect URI in both Google Cloud Console and your Unraid OIDC configuration to use the valid domain.
:::

For Google Workspace domains, use Advanced Mode with the `hd` claim to restrict access to your organization's domain.

### Authelia

Configure OIDC client in your Authelia `configuration.yml` with client ID `unraid-api` and generate a hashed secret using the Authelia hash-password command.

**Configuration:**

- **Issuer URL**: `https://auth.yourdomain.com`
- **Client ID**: `unraid-api` (or as configured in Authelia)
- **Client Secret**: Your unhashed secret
- **Required Scopes**: `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `groups`
- **Redirect URI**: `http://YOUR_UNRAID_IP/graphql/api/auth/oidc/callback`

Use Advanced Mode with `groups` claim for group-based authorization.

### Microsoft/Azure AD

Register a new app in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) under Azure Active Directory → App registrations. Note the Application ID, create a client secret, and note your tenant ID.

**Configuration:**

- **Issuer URL**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/v2.0`
- **Client ID**: Your Application (client) ID
- **Client Secret**: Generated client secret
- **Required Scopes**: `openid`, `profile`, `email`
- **Redirect URI**: `http://YOUR_UNRAID_IP/graphql/api/auth/oidc/callback`

Authorization rules can be configured in the interface using email domains or advanced claims.

### Keycloak

Create a new confidential client in Keycloak Admin Console with `openid-connect` protocol and copy the client secret from the Credentials tab.

**Configuration:**

- **Issuer URL**: `https://keycloak.example.com/realms/YOUR_REALM`
- **Client ID**: `unraid-api` (or as configured in Keycloak)
- **Client Secret**: From Keycloak Credentials tab
- **Required Scopes**: `openid`, `profile`, `email`
- **Redirect URI**: `http://YOUR_UNRAID_IP/graphql/api/auth/oidc/callback`

For role-based authorization, use Advanced Mode with `realm_access.roles` or `resource_access` claims.

### Authentik

Create a new OAuth2/OpenID Provider in Authentik, then create an Application and link it to the provider.

**Configuration:**

- **Issuer URL**: `https://authentik.example.com/application/o/unraid-api/`
- **Client ID**: From Authentik provider configuration
- **Client Secret**: From Authentik provider configuration
