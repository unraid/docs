# Using the Unraid API

The Unraid API provides a %%GraphQL|graphql%% interface that allows you to interact with your Unraid server. This guide covers authentication, common queries, and usage patterns.

## Enabling the GraphQL sandbox

### WebGUI method (recommended)

Using the %%WebGUI|web-gui%% is the easiest way to enable the %%GraphQL|graphql%% sandbox:

1. Navigate to ***Settings → Management Access → Developer Options***
2. Enable the **%%GraphQL|graphql%% Sandbox** toggle
3. Access the %%GraphQL|graphql%% playground by navigating to:

   ```txt
   http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/graphql
   ```

### CLI method

Alternatively, you can enable developer mode using the CLI:

```bash
unraid-api developer --sandbox true
```

Or use the interactive mode:

```bash
unraid-api developer
```

## Authentication

Most queries and mutations require authentication. Always include appropriate credentials in your requests. You can authenticate using:

1. **API Keys** - For programmatic access
2. **Cookies** - Automatic when signed in to the %%WebGUI|web-gui%%
3. **%%SSO|sso%%/OIDC** - When configured with external providers

### Managing API keys

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gui" label="Web GUI (Recommended)" default>
    <ManageApiKeysGui />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI Method">
    <ManageApiKeysCli />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using API keys

The generated API key should be included in your %%GraphQL|graphql%% requests as a header.

```json
{
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

## Available schemas

The API provides access to various aspects of your Unraid server:

- **System information**: Query system details including CPU, memory, and OS information; monitor system status and health; access baseboard and hardware information.
- **%%Array|array%% management**: Query %%array|array%% status and configuration; manage %%array|array%% operations (start/stop); monitor disk status and health; perform %%parity checks|parity-check%%. For more information about array operations, see [Array overview](../unraid-os/using-unraid-to/manage-storage/array/overview.mdx).
- **Docker management**: List and manage Docker containers; monitor container status; manage Docker networks.
- **Remote access**: Configure and manage remote access settings; handle %%SSO|sso%% configuration; manage allowed origins.

## Example queries

### Check system status

```graphql
query {
    info {
        os {
            platform
            distro
            release
            uptime
        }
        cpu {
            manufacturer
            brand
            cores
            threads
        }
    }
}
```

### Monitor array status

```graphql
query {
    array {
        state
        capacity {
            disks {
                free
                used
                total
            }
        }
        disks {
            name
            size
            status
            temp
        }
    }
}
```

### List Docker containers

```graphql
query {
    dockerContainers {
        id
        names
        state
        status
        autoStart
    }
}
```

## Schema types

The API includes several core types. Base types include `Node` (interface for objects with unique IDs; see [Object Identification](https://graphql.org/learn/global-object-identification/)), `JSON` (for complex JSON data), `DateTime` (for timestamp values), and `Long` (for 64-bit integers). Resource types include `Array` (%%array|array%% and disk management), `Docker` (container and network management), `Info` (system information), `Config` (server configuration), and `Connect` (remote access settings). Available roles are `admin` (full access), `connect` (remote access features), and `guest` (limited read access).

Use the Apollo Sandbox to explore the schema and test queries. Start with small queries and gradually add fields as needed. Monitor your query complexity to maintain performance, use appropriate roles and permissions for your API keys, and keep your API keys secure by rotating them periodically.

## Error handling and rate limiting

The API returns standard %%GraphQL|graphql%% errors in the following format:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Error description",
      "locations": [...],
      "path": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Ensure your applications handle rate limit responses appropriately. Use the Apollo Sandbox's schema explorer to browse all available types and fields, and check the documentation tab for detailed field descriptions. Monitor the API's health using `unraid-api status` and generate reports using `unraid-api report` for troubleshooting. For more information about specific commands and configuration options, refer to the [CLI documentation](cli.mdx) or run `unraid-api --help`. If you encounter issues, visit the [Unraid forums](https://forums.unraid.net/) for community support.
