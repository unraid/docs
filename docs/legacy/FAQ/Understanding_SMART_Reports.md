## Prologue

There is a lot of ignorance and misinformation out there about SMART
reports, so this will be an effort to help users to a better
understanding of the content of SMART reports.

Consider the following SMART report extract:

Looks rather intimidating, doesn't it, with huge scary numbers! But
with a little knowledge from this page, you should be able to quickly
say "That drive looks fine! A little warm though!"

\
==Introduction to SMART==

From [SMART on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T),
"S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology; often
written as SMART) is a monitoring system for computer hard disk drives
to detect and report on various indicators of reliability, in the hope
of anticipating failures." It was a laudable effort by the drive
manufacturers to provide standard ways to both report current drive
parameters and status, and also indicate issues, especially those that
might be predictive of imminent drive failure. Unfortunately, the
standard had considerable ambiguity, and the various drive engineers
have often differed greatly in their interpretations and implementations
of both the common attributes, and the introduction of new attributes.

This page is primarily a guide to understanding SMART attributes, in
real world usage. They are unfortunately very inconsistent in their
behavior, not only between the different attributes, but between the
various drive models, and especially between brands. In some cases, the
RAW_VALUE is the counter to watch, in others, it is more important to
watch what the VALUE does, and there are yet other behaviors too. To
understand a particular attribute report line, you have to understand
how that SMART attribute is usually handled, keeping in mind who the
manufacturer is, and to a lesser extent, what drive model it is. You can
try researching it online, but information is really skimpy, nothing
authoritative at all from the manufacturers themselves. The table of
SMART attributes below should help you understand them, but every
manufacturer uses a different set of SMART attributes, even using the
common ones in differing ways, even across their own drive models.

There are many computer professionals with a very low opinion of SMART
reporting, and they generally discount SMART reports, partly because of
all the inconsistency, but also because many drives fail with no SMART
warnings at all. I find that once you understand the inconsistencies,
and keep some perspective, there is much that can still be learned. For
one example, the Seek_Error_Rate (a critical attribute) on Seagate
drives generally starts and stays in the mid 50's to high 60's
(attribute values generally start at 100 and drop to 1). Not knowing
this, you might immediately think there is a serious issue with your new
Seagate drive. But now that you do know this, you won't be concerned
until it drops into the low 50's or below. The same Seek_Error_Rate
value on any other brand would be immediately concerning. Hopefully the
table below will help you understand what 'normal' looks like, for the
different attributes on different drives by different makers.

\
===SMART overall health test===

- Basic overall health test of the drive, only 2 choices - PASSED or
    FAILED
- If test result is FAILED, then that means the SMART firmware
    believes that the drive is in imminent danger of catastrophic
    failure, so it is imperative to copy off ALL important data.
    Usually, it is best to copy off the most important files, then the
    next most important files, then the next, and so on, because the
    drive may completely quit before you finish copying.

```

    SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED

\
===SMART parameters section===

- These are generally of little interest to us
- They do include the recommended polling time for the short and long
    tests, in other words don't request a SMART report any sooner than
    this recommendation
  - Unfortunately the original standard must have stipulated using a
        single byte to store the polling times, which caps their maximum
        value at 255. That makes the 'Extended self-test' (the long
        test) polling time of 255 rather useless.
- I have seen a case where an unusually long 'Total time to complete
    Offline data collection' for one unusually slow drive was the only
    indication of a faulty drive. The SMART reports for other drives
    that were exactly the same model had essentially identical SMART
    reports, with no issues, except for the difference in this
    parameter.

===SMART attributes section===

- This is the table of SMART attributes for this drive. The columns
    are described below the example. Yours may greatly differ from this
    example, as some drives report more attributes, and some drives
    report considerably fewer. The newest drives often introduce new
    attributes.

- Column 1 is the attribute number, usually a decimal number between 1
    and 255. Some SMART tools report it in hex, from 01 to FF. These are
    relatively standard ID's, except that different manufacturers will
    occasionally introduce a new one, unused by anyone else. Generally,
    the only ones you can count on seeing are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10,
    187, 190 or 194, 193, 195, 197, 198, and 199.
- Column 2 is the relatively standardized attribute name. There are a
    few that seem only used by a single manufacturer.
- Column 3 is the attribute handling flag, of no interest to us -
    ignore it.
- Column 4 is the VALUE, one of the most important values in the
    table. It is stored in a single byte on the drive for each SMART
    attribute, so its range is from 0 to 255.
  - However, the values of 0, 254, and 255 are reserved for internal
        use, so you never see them.
  - The value of 253 usually always means "Not Used Yet", so when
        you see it, you are probably looking at a brand new drive.
        Sometimes though, there can be a few attributes that take awhile
        before they are used, so may stay 253 for longer.
  - VALUE is almost always used as a normalized scale of perfectly
        good to perfectly bad, usually starting at VALUE=100, then
        dropping toward a worst case of VALUE=1. You can generally think
        of it as representing a scale starting at 100% good, then slowly
        dropping until failure at some predetermined percentage number,
        in the THRESHOLD column.
  - Someone realized that if the values only run from 100 to 1, then
        they are wasting the possible values from 101 to 252, so some
        SMART programmers have decided to stretch the scale for certain
        attributes to start at 200 instead of 100, providing twice the
        data points. Unfortunately, which attributes are scaled from 200
        to 1 is completely inconsistent, with almost all SMART reports
        showing some attributes starting at 100, and other attributes
        starting at 200. In addition, there are a few Maxtor and Samsung
        drives that took the start of the scale all the way to 252 or
        253! Above, you see all but 1 attribute using 100, the exception
        being attribute 199 which starts at 200. In general, you can
        think of 200-type scales as 100 times 2 (just divide the number
        by 2), and from now on, that is what we are going to do in most
        of the discussion.
  - The temperature attributes 190 and 194 are exceptions to the
        scaling. They are either temperatures or forms of the
        temperature, and they don't scale (their WORST value may look
        like it scales though).
  - The error rate attributes 1 and 7 are also exceptions, although
        of a different kind. Raw read and seek errors are a natural part
        of normal operation, so even in a brand new and perfect drive,
        there is a factory-determined optimal rate of read and seek
        errors. They are nothing to worry about, they're the natural
        result of temperature expansion and other things, and they are
        used to help the drive constantly recalibrate itself. But
        because these error rates are non-zero, you essentially cannot
        have a perfect error rate of zero that you declare is a VALUE
        of 100. So manufacturers determine what an optimal error rate
        should be and call it 100. But often, drives may achieve an
        error rate (especially when they are new) that is even better
        than the optimal one set by the manufacturer, which results in
        an error rate that is HIGHER than 100! For an example, see the
        VALUE above of attribute 1, the Raw_Read_Error_Rate. It's as if
        the drive is performing at 111%!
- Column 5 is WORST, the lowest VALUE ever recorded (except for a few
    unusual and uncommon cases).
  - *[incomplete]*
- Column 6 is THRESH, the manufacturer determined lowest value that
    WORST should be allowed to fall to, before reporting it as a FAILED
    quantity. Some are counters, some are informational such as
    temperature or hours used or
  - *[incomplete]*
- Column 7 is TYPE, the type of attribute. It can either be *Pre-fail*
    or *Old_age*.
  - If it is *Pre-fail*, then the attribute is considered a critical
        attribute, one that participates in the overall SMART health
        assessment (PASSED/FAILED) of the drive. If the value of WORST
        falls below THRESH, then the drive FAILS the overall SMART
        health test, and complete failure may be imminent. The
        *Pre-fail* term means that if this attribute fails, then the
        drive is considered 'about to fail'.
  - If it is *Old_age*, then the attribute is considered (for SMART
        purposes) a noncritical attribute, one that does not fail the
        drive. The *Old_age* term means that the attribute is related to
        normal aging, normal wear and tear of the drive.
  - When new attributes are introduced, they may seem like a
        critical item, perhaps even with an appropriate THRESH set. But
        if they are marked as *Old_age*, then they do NOT fail the
        drive, even if WORST falls below THRESH. Naturally, this could
        be highly concerning, but there is no authoritative
        interpretation available, so no definitive conclusions can be
        made. These attributes should be considered *Experimental*.
  - *[incomplete]*
- Column 8 is UPDATED. Supposedly, this is an indicator when the
    attribute is updated, *Always* or *Offline*. If *Always*, then it is
    assumed that the attribute is updated whenever a relevant event
    occurs. In other words, it is always 'live'. If *Offline*, then
    supposedly the attribute is only updated when offline tests are
    being performed. But in real life, our experience is that these are
    inaccurate. Just look at the example above, at attributes 241
    and 242. They appear to be live counters of LBA's read and written,
    yet the test section of that particular SMART report indicates that
    there have been no offline tests performed!
- Column 9 is WHEN_FAILED, usually and thankfully blank! If not blank,
    then it indicates the last operational hour (from attribute 9

- Column 10 is RAW_VALUE, a manufacturer controlled raw number, which
    may or may not be of interest to us. From now on, we will often
    shorten its name and refer to it only as 'the RAW'.

### 1 Raw_Read_Error_Rate

- This is an indicator of the current rate of errors of the low level
    physical sector read operations. In normal operation, there are
    ALWAYS a small number of errors when attempting to read sectors, but
    as long as the number remains small, there is NO issue with the
    drive. Error correction information and retry mechanisms are in
    place to catch and fix these errors. Manufacturers therefore
    determine an optimal level of errors for each drive model, and set
    up an appropriate scale for monitoring the current error rate. For
    example, if 3 errors per 1000 read operations seems near perfect to
    the manufacturer, then an error rate of 3 per 1000 ops might be set
    to an attribute VALUE of 100. If the rate increased to 10 per 1000,
    then the rate might be scaled to 80 (completely under manufacturer
    control, and NEVER revealed or explained to us!).
- They are called Raw Reads to distinguish them from the more common
    term 'read errors', which represent a much higher level read
    operation. What we usually refer to as a 'read error' is an error
    returned by a read process, that has attempted a series of one or
    more seeks and raw reads, plus optional error corrections and
    retries. It either returns an indicator of total success plus the
    sector data (considered to be in perfect shape), or it returns an
    error code, and no sector data.
- **PLEASE completely ignore the RAW_VALUE number!** Only Seagates
    report the raw value, which yes, does appear to be the number of raw
    read errors, but should be ignored, completely. All other drives
    have raw read errors too, but do not report them, leaving this value
    as zero only. To repeat, Seagates are not worse than other drives
    because they appear to have raw read errors, rather they are the
    only one to report the number. I suspect that others do not report
    the number to avoid a lot of confusion, and questions for their tech
    support people. Seagate leaves those of us who provide tech support
    the job of answering the constant questions about this number.
    Hopefully now that you understand this, you will never bother a kind
    IT person with questions about the Raw_Read_Error_Rate RAW_VALUE
    again?
