\
\-\-\-\-- Important version note: This document is no longer for
**WINDOWS** users. In general, you should use [Unraid Server
Installation](https://unraid.net/download) instead. With the advent of
the all-in-one releases (as of v4.6 Final), a **make_bootable.bat**
batch installation file is included, that replaces the use of the
**syslinux** utility in preparing the flash drives for booting unRAID.
The instructions below do still work, and are necessary for installing
versions of unRAID earlier than v4.6 Final, and for preparing a flash
drive on a Mac. And there is still value in the advanced troubleshooting
tips below.\>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
\
**Be sure to review the [Hardware
Compatibility](Hardware_Compatibility "wikilink") page when designing
your server.**

The Unraid Server OS is designed to be installed on, and boot from a USB
Flash storage device, 512MB or larger. Use a high quality Flash drive
from reputable manufacturers such as:

- Lexar
- PNY
- Samsung
- Kingston
- And many more listed in the [Hardware Compatibility#USB Flash
    Drives](Hardware_Compatibility#USB_Flash_Drives "wikilink") section

`Note: If you are upgrading from a pre-3.0 release of unRAID Server, please read the`[`Pre-3.0 Upgrade Instructions`](Pre-3.0_Upgrade_Instructions "wikilink")`first.`

## Instructions

### Windows XP

**Step 1** Plug the Flash into your PC and re-format it using Windows
(right-click the Flash under **My Computer** and select **Format**):

- For **File system**, select **FAT32**
- For **Volume label**, enter **UNRAID** (exactly 6 capital letters)
- Select **Quick Format** and click **Start**
- For many, the above steps were all that was necessary to format the
    drive. For others, selecting a file system of **FAT** or **FAT16**
    was necessary, and others found that formatting it with the **HP
    Flash Formatter Tool** was required, or even other steps. If you
    determine that the Windows formatting did not succeed in creating a
    bootable USB drive, then see the Advanced tips at the bottom.

**Step 2** Download the **syslinux** tool from the [Lime Tech
download](http://lime-technology.com/download/) page, and extract
**syslinux.exe** to a simple directory, for example, **`c:\`**, and then
run it by clicking on **Start** / **Run**. In the dialog box, enter:

`c:\syslinux.exe -ma f:`

If necessary, change the directory from **`c:\`** to whatever directory
you downloaded **syslinux** to, and change the **`f:`** to use whatever
drive letter that Windows mounted your Flash on.

The **syslinux** tool will create a hidden system file named
**`ldlinux.sys`** on the Flash and make the drive bootable. The latest
version and a complete distribution of **syslinux** is available
[here](http://syslinux.zytor.com/).

**Step 3** Download the latest [unRAID
Server](http://lime-technology.com/download), and extract the files from
the zip archive to your Flash. When extracting the files, make sure that
the option to preserve the folder structure is selected. There is a
**config** folder with initial configuration files, that needs to be
correctly extracted. If done correctly, you should see **bzroot** and
**bzimage** on the flash drive, plus a **config** folder containing
files such as **network.cfg** and **ident.cfg**.

**Step 4** Click on the **Safely Remove Hardware** tool tray icon and
select your Flash drive to be safely removed.\
\

### Windows Vista and Windows 7

**Step 1** Plug the Flash into your PC and re-format it using Windows
(Right-Click the Flash under **Computer** and select **Format**):

- For **File system**, leave it as **Default**
- For **Volume label**, enter **UNRAID** (exactly 6 capital letters)
- Check the **Quick Format** box and click **Start**

If you determine that the Windows formatting did not succeed in creating
a bootable USB drive, then see the Advanced tips at the bottom.

**Step 2** Download the latest [unRAID
Server](http://lime-technology.com/download), and extract the files from
the zip archive to your Flash.

**Step 3** On the Flash drive, Right-Click on **make_bootable.bat** and
select **Run as administrator**. Press any key to continue.

**Step 4** The process takes only a moment to complete. You can then
close any open windows and eject the Flash drive.\
\

### MacOS X

You'll need to download the following:

- [unetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net) - installs unRAID on
    your flash drive for you
- [syslinux](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/) - a
    collection of linux tools that will allow you to make the drive
    bootable
- unRAID - don't unzip it\...

**1. Plug in your USB Flash drive and format it using Disk Utility.**

- Open Disk Utility (Applications -\> Utilities-\> Disk Utility) and
    choose your device from the list on the left - note: In recent
    versions of macOS you will need to select View \> Show All Devices.
    Please make sure to read carefully to know when to select "Device"
    or "Partition"
- Select Partition
- Choose Partition Layout: 1 Partition
- Call it 'UNRAID' (no spaces, all caps)
- Click Options and make sure Master Boot Record is selected
- Click Apply and your disk will format

**2. Verify the new partition**

- Choose the UNRAID partition from the list on the left
- Select First Aid and Verify Disk
- Check the "Show Details" box and get the device path for your
    disk, ex: /dev/disk2s1
- Unmount the **partition** by clicking "Unmount" in the top menu
- leave Disk Utility open, you'll need it again

**3. Make the partition Bootable**

- Open Terminal (Applications -\> Utilities -\> Terminal)
- Now you'll need the raw disk device name.. so if your partition
    device path was /dev/disk2s1, the raw device name is /dev/rdisk2,
    basically you drop the s1 off the end (that's the partition number)
    and add in a r before disk
- Type the following command, substituting `<device>`{=html} for your
    raw deivce name ex: /dev/rdisk2 and press enter

`fdisk -e ``<device>`{=html}

- At the \> prompt type the following and press enter between each

`f 1`\
`write`\
`exit`

Note: if you get an error about the device not being available for
writing, ensure you have Unmounted the partition in Disk Utility

- Unmount the partition again in Disk Utility (the above command will
    cause it to be remounted)
- Unzip/tar your syslinux download (you can leave it in the Downloads
    folder
- cd to that folder in terminal by typing the following (you may need
    to change the version number to match your download)

`cd ~/Downloads/syslinux-4.05/mbr`

- Install the bootable MBR on your flash drive with the following
    command (again substituting `<device>`{=html} for your raw device
    name)

`dd conv=notrunc bs=440 count=1 if=mbr.bin of=``<device>`{=html}

**4. Install unRAID on your prepared Flash Drive**

- Change the extension of your unRAID download from zip to iso
- Open unetbootin (it will need your password)
- Choose Disk Image at the bottom and browse for your unRAID iso
- Choose the device path for your partition (it's probably already
    selected)
- Click OK

Note: if you get an error about overwriting menu.c32, click Yes To All

- When it finishes, you can eject your USB Flash Drive and put it in
    your unRAID server and power it up

I Think this would work with Windows, Linux versions also. So if any one
has Windows or Linux can you try this and write here if it works there
also.

## Booting unRAID Server

Safely remove/eject the Flash from your PC and plug it into your server.
Power up your server and see if it immediately boots (with some
motherboards it will). If it does not boot to the unRAID boot screen
that displays a choice of starting unRAID or Memtest, reboot your server
and enter the BIOS setup. Navigate to the appropriate screen(s) and
select your USB Flash device as the boot device. In some BIOS, the flash
drive may show up in the list of hard disks, and you may have to select
it there. Save your BIOS settings and try to boot the Flash. Be aware
that some motherboards will change the boot order when you add hard
drives, and you will have to return to these same BIOS screens to
re-select your flash drive.

Note: You may need to check

Setup Tips* and *Other BIOS Suggestions*. For machines with an AMI BIOS,
check

For more general BIOS suggestions on getting a machine to boot the USB
flash drive, check

near the bottom of the page. There may be additional information in the
FAQ section [Flash Drives](FAQ#Flash_Drives "wikilink"), especially the
FAQ entry, "[How do I configure the BIOS settings to allow booting from
the USB flash
drive?](FAQ#How_do_I_configure_the_BIOS_settings_to_allow_booting_from_the_USB_flash_drive.3F "wikilink")"\
\

## If the Flash will not boot, read over the following tips

Unfortunately, some motherboards and BIOS versions are very picky about
the geometry or configuration of the USB flash drive. Some combinations
of motherboard, BIOS, and flash drive do not work, or only work after
more advanced 'modifications'. The following tips are what users have
found to work, in different situations. If one does not work for you,
try another.

- If your flash drive had pre-installed "U3" software, it will need
    to be removed before you format and install unRAID on it. U3
    Un-Install software is available
    [here](http://www.u3.com/uninstall/). A U3 removal tool specific to
    SanDisk drives can be found
    [here](http://u3.sandisk.com/launchpadremoval.htm).

```{=html}

```

- Some instructions for loading **syslinux** on your flash drive leave
    off the "**-ma**" options of the command. If your flash drive does
    not have a preloaded master boot record and a partition marked as
    "active", then it is unlikely to boot unless you use the **-ma**
    options.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

- Try formatting the USB drive as FAT instead of FAT32

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

- You may need to use the **HP formatting tool** to make your flash
    drive bootable on your BIOS. It sets the Cylinders/Heads/Sector
    geometry of a flash drive to an alternate set of geometry values.
    The alternate geometry will often will make it possible to use your
    flash drive as a boot disk when your BIOS does not work with the
    existing geometry. For more info, see
    [here](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=359.0) and
    [here](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=366.0) and
    [here](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=2703.0).

```{=html}

```

- Apparently, there is more than one version of the **HP format
    tool**. The version of the **HP USB Format Tool** that works best
    has a file name of **SP27213.exe**. Some have had problems with the
    version named **SP27608.exe**. (eg. Sandisk 16GB Cruzer Contour &
    Amicroe 32GB). HP seems to have removed both from their downloads
    section of their website, but Google **HP SP27213.exe** and you
    should be able to find it easily.

- If it appears as if the flash drive tries to boot, but hangs while
    decompressing the **bzroot** or **bzimage** files on the flash, it
    is possible that either the **bzroot** or **bzimage** file is
    corrupt or incomplete. This could happen if you did not safely eject
    the flash drive, after copying the files to it when it was plugged
    into your PC. The file would only have been partially written to the
    flash drive.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

- If it appears as if the flash drive tries to boot, but only gets
    part way before hanging, you may need to add additional options to
    your **syslinux.cfg** file on your flash drive to boot your
    motherboard. Tips on how to proceed are here: [USB Boot
    Issues](Best_of_the_Forums#USB_Boot_Issues "wikilink")

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

- If it appears as if the flash drive gets part way through the boot
    process but stops when loading **bzroot**, you may need to use the
    latest version of **syslinux** in the
    [downloads](http://lime-technology.com/dnlds) folder at
    Lime-Technology. Use of **syslinux version 3.63** in combination
    with the **-ma** option was the solution in [this
    thread](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=1176.msg15666#msg15666).
    (After downloading [syslinux
    3.63.zip](http://download.lime-technology.com/syslinux%203.63.zip),
    extract **syslinux.exe** from the zip file.) A number of users
    upgrading from a v4.2 version to a v4.3 version have found that the
    new **syslinux** is necessary, even though their flash drive had
    worked fine with v4.2.

```{=html}

```

- If it appears as if the flash drive gets part way through the boot
    process but reboots when loading **bzroot**, one user found that he
    fixed it be replacing his graphics card with an older (possibly more
    basic) graphics card.

- A user has created another procedure based on the **makebootfat**
    tool. This procedure seems especially useful for newer Intel boards,
    such as boards based on the P965, P35, and P45 chipsets and their G
    variants. See
    [this](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=2407.0)
    post. It worked when nothing else would, on his Intel P965-based
    board.

```{=html}

```

- Also see
    [this](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=922.0)
    thread (uses a Knoppix installation or Live CD), if you have a board
    that will only boot from a flash drive as a USB-ZIP drive. Similar
    instructions, using Ubuntu or similar, can be found here:
    <http://www.pendrivelinux.com/booting-linux-from-usb-zip-on-older-systems/>.

- With some older motherboards, it may not be possible to boot from a
    USB drive. Sometimes, upgrading to the latest BIOS for your board
    will add support. But if not, there are still other choices. The
    best may be to find a newer motherboard! There also are ways to boot
    from another device, which then continues the boot process from your
    unRAID USB flash drive. See
    [this](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=244.msg21554#msg21554)
    post, and the following posts, for a 'kicker' floppy disk. See
    [this](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=244.msg43236#msg43236)
    post for a 'kicker' CD. There are also other threads about kicker
    disks, search **kicker**. You may be able to adapt the kicker disk
    to a bootable CD, and there are efforts under way to boot from a
    small extra hard disk or a Cache disk, see the
    [PLoP](UnRAID_Topical_Index#PLoP_Boot_Manager "wikilink") topic for
    one method. The unRAID system still requires a valid USB flash drive
    installed, and labeled correctly, but a kicker disk can handle the
    initial booting, and then transfer control to the unRAID flash drive
    to continue booting unRAID. More information can be found in the
    [UnRAID Topical Index, Kicker
    disks](UnRAID_Topical_Index#Kicker_disks "wikilink") section.
    *[editor note: may later move this to separate section below. this
    needs more kicker-related links]*

```{=html}

```

- And last of all, try upgrading the BIOS of your motherboard. A later
    BIOS may have better support for booting from USB.
