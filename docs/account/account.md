# Unraid Account

## What is an Unraid.net Account?

An [Unraid.net account](https://account.unraid.net/) is the account you create to use the [Unraid forums](https://forums.unraid.net/), use [Unraid Connect](/connect/index.md), and to manage your Unraid keys. This account is _not the same_ as your server's root password that you use to login to the Unraid webgui. Users do not need to sign into this account to use Unraid.

## Unraid.net Account Sign In / Ups

The unraid.net account is a single-sign-on (SSO) system that is used for authenticating users to Unraidâ€™s online systems with a single account. This system is accessed through the website located at account.unraid.net.

This SSO service is implemented on top of an AWS Cognito OAuth server, which is a private user pool database. User privacy is a top priority for us, and all data is stored securely and encrypted.

The AWS Cognito user pool database stores the following data about registered users:

* User ID, Username, Email address, Unraid Forum ID, User authorized to download Unraid prereleases
* This database also stores attributes used for login, such as Password hash, MFA details, and Google/Apple SSO information.
