## Creating and Submitting Plugins

Plugins are `.plg` files (XML-based) that install software or features directly on Unraid. They have stricter moderation due to root access.

## Step 1: Create the Plugin PLG File

- PLG files define installation steps, such as downloading binaries, setting permissions, and integrating with the Unraid UI.
- Use an existing PLG as a template (e.g., from GitHub repos).

Example basic PLG structure:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' standalone='yes'?>
<!DOCTYPE PLUGIN [
<!ENTITY name "MyPlugin">
<!ENTITY author "YourName">
<!ENTITY version "2025.10.18">
<!ENTITY pluginURL "https://github.com/user/repo">
<!ENTITY icon "plug">
]>
<PLUGIN name="&name;" author="&author;" version="&version;" pluginURL="&pluginURL;" icon="&icon;" min="6.12.0">
  <DESCRIPTION>Short description of the plugin.</DESCRIPTION>
  <CHANGES>Changelog here.</CHANGES>
  <FILE Name="/boot/config/plugins/&name;/install.sh" Run="up">
    <!-- Installation script content -->
  </FILE>
  <!-- Additional FILE elements for downloads, configs, etc. -->
</PLUGIN>
```

- Include scripts for installation, updates, and removal.
- Test on a local Unraid system by placing the `.plg` in `/config/plugins` on the flash drive and rebooting.

## Step 2: Host on GitHub

- Create a GitHub repo and upload the `.plg` file.
- Add `ca_profile.xml` if desired (same as for Docker apps).

## Step 3: Submit to Community Applications

- Plugins follow similar submission rules as Docker apps but are ineligible if better suited as Dockers.
- Create a support thread on the Unraid forums.
- Submit via PM to moderator @Squid or use the Docker submission form (adapt for plugins).
- Moderators review for security, openness (open-source preferred), and compatibility. Closed-source plugins are rarely accepted.
