# Unraid Docs style guide

Unraid OS is shaped by the LimeTech team and the Unraid community. Our documentation aims to be comprehensive, accurate, and current. Since our users come from diverse backgrounds worldwide, this guide sets the foundation for consistent, clear writing throughout Unraid docs.

---

## Writing conventions

### Style and tone

Our tone strikes a balance between friendly and formal, aiming for detailed and accurate content that users can relate to.

- Use formal, direct instructions when the action is fixed and leaves no room for deviation.
- Use a conversational, explanatory tone when providing context or scenarios to make the content more approachable.

As a contributor, consider the context and audience when choosing your tone.

:::important

Because Unraid OS has a global audience, we avoid jargon, slang, or idioms. These can confuse non-native English speakers and complicate the translation process.

:::

### Audience: Write for all levels

Our readers range from Linux experts who understand system internals to beginners navigating Unraid for the first time.

Write clearly and inclusively so that both experts and newcomers can follow along smoothly.

### The ABC method: accuracy, brevity, clarity

We prioritize:

- **Accuracy**: Ensure content is correct and thoroughly tested.
- **Brevity**: Be concise without sacrificing necessary detail.
- **Clarity**: Use plain language and structure content for easy understanding.

## Formatting for lists and tables

Using structured elements, such as lists and tables, effectively improves information clarity, aids comprehension, and supports quick reference.

### Lists

Lists help users absorb, recall, and follow key points or steps. There are two main types, each with clear use cases:

- **Unordered lists** (bullets): Use to group related items without implying order.
  *Example:* "List of common Unraid OS tools."

- **Ordered lists** (numbered): Use to show a required sequence or procedure.
  *Example:* "To start the %%array|array%%..."

:::tip Best practices

- Try to introduce the list with a clear stem sentence ending in a colon.
- Use 4–6 items max in an unordered list for ease of scanning and memorability. Longer lists may be better as a table.

:::

### Tables

Tables are a great way to organize related data by grouping information into rows and columns, which makes comparisons quicker and more precise.

:::tip Best practices

- Use tables for multiple related data points that benefit from side-by-side comparison.
- Avoid tables with only 1 or 2 cells; instead, use bulleted lists or sentences.
- Introduce the table with a sentence that explains its purpose and content.

## Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms

To reduce confusion for readers, follow these principles regarding abbreviations:

- **Abbreviations** are shortened forms of words that are usually unnecessary in Unraid Docs unless they are universally recognized.
- **Acronyms** create new words from the initial letters of other words (e.g., %%RAID|raid%%).
- **Initialisms** use initials that are pronounced individually (e.g., OS, %%ZFS|zfs%%).

**Recommendations:**

- Prefer existing, well-known acronyms or initialisms that are familiar to your audience.
- Avoid creating new abbreviations just for the sake of being brief.
- Always spell out uncommon acronyms or initialisms the first time they are used, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
  *Example:* Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK)

## Hyperlinking to other documents or sites

Strategic linking allows readers to explore related topics and enhances their understanding. Use these guidelines for practical and accessible hyperlinking.

### Link text guidelines

- Link text should clearly describe the destination, helping all readers grasp the link’s purpose.
- Steer clear of vague link texts like "Click here" or "Read more," as these lack context.
- Avoid using raw URLs as inline link text.

### Formatting links

- Use inline Markdown links:

```
You can also check our [writing tips and guidelines](../unraid-styleguide/conventions.mdx).
```

- Always link to the most relevant and authoritative resource available.

### Adding glossary terminology

Unraid Docs utilizes a centralized glossary system to ensure consistency and accessibility of technical terms. Glossary entries are kept in the `glossary.yaml` file located in the root directory.

To add or update a term:

1. Edit `glossary.yaml` using the following template:

```
GlossaryTerm:
  term: Display Name
  def: Full definition text.
  link: <a href="https://example.com">Optional detailed link</a>
```

2. To add tooltip functionality, reference the term in documentation using the syntax:

   ```
   %%Term|GlossaryTerm%%
   ```

   ...where the left side of the pipe is the text you would like it displayed, while the right side is the corresponding term entry from the YAML file.

3. 3. The [glossary page](../glossary.mdx) will automatically update to include new terms.
